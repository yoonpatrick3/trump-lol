Remove Impact, Broxah, and the coaching staff.

Add YamatoCannon and Reignover as the new coaching staff, then add Ssumday and Xmithie.
He didnt play like “shit” this split, he jsut wasnt as good as he was last year. But his team played way worse. Go back and watch the games he played from an adc perspective. Wtf do you do when TL post Xmithie no longer plays bot, impact is high in top and keeps dying and jensen is coinflip, some game amazing some games bad. Core himself plays badly a lot this split. DL was def not the issue this split and the fact that they benched him (and quickly brought him back) shows that TL has incompetent management.
> Agree to disagree on mages. Mage itemization is quite strong atm. Zoe, Syndra, Le Blanc, Diana, Kass and TF are all very strong right now. Just look at Masters+ Pick Rates and the corresponding win rates. 

And sort by pickrate low-high and it'll also be made up of mages. Again, mages as a whole aren't super strong, certain picks are.

> As for ADC's, that is most certainly not the "nature of ADC"'s. It is just the current meta. Plenty of metas in the past have had ADC as the strongest role with the greatest carry potential. 

Even in the ardent meta they weren't really carrying. They were the most important member, sure, but it was constant 4-5 man bot plays that decided the game.
Is tahm kench any good? I used to play him a lot but then he got gutted by q not stacking.
And prior to this split, they had won the 4 before that lol. You can't do it every year.
You might get punished for it once every 10 games or so, I guess, maybe

When Hillary becomes president nothing will change for me, I'll still live in a country of ruined dreams ruled by authoritarian mob boss.
I think what makes them better internationally is that they aren't a one dimensional team. Enemies can't throw them a curveball as hard as TL for example, and because of their broad understanding of the game, are faster to adapt. TL when they won seemed more polished but were more one dimensional. Going for the master of one versus jack of all trades allowed them to be the best in NA, but were unprepared for the rest.

DL has won so many splits, MSI Finals, he alone is bigger than C9. NA is such a joke, even memeing your most iconic player. DL despite currently being off-form is bigger than the entire C9 Org in League. Besides, C9 would have gotten murdered even harder than TL in that Group last year. At least TL took a Game off of DWG there, C9 would have never been able to do that in a million years

Good 1
Awkward moment when every single team is full with smurfs styling on you and going 18/0
TL has several analysts and Impact having a shit split is no reason to dump him. He smurfs in every high pressure situation and carried them in every tourney last year. TL just has absolutely no grasp on the meta, and if they do then they aren’t willing to play around it. Every other region’s top teams (plus C9) all play super early game focused and play incredibly aggro. This is done especially through mid and jungle. Broxah is trying his damned hardest but Jensen is still playing like a korean from 2014. He needs to sacrifice some cs and lane and roam to help out his team. Look at Nisqy, Perkz, DoinB, and their playstyles. And TL refuses to pick up any new champs or try anything aside from the same teamfight comps they played all last year. Their roster is fine, they just need to adapt to the meta, not take on every bad stereotype of NA all at once.
If they removed the damage entirely from brittle even with a lot of compensation he would be a joke of a champion these people are insane. In solo queue he's performing poorly in every elo compared to other top laners and they seem to complain about his damage despite the fact that he did this much damage for like a year before he became FOTM lol
> like a bottom-tier team

Liquidate CLG. Just embarrassing at this point. Most unlikeable and unwatchable lineup I've watched as a CLG fan.
Hm, well I appreciate your efforts, I hope your server succeeds. We definitely need more female gamers.
My mom just entered my room and asked me to stop watching this garbage thing. I told her that League of Legends was a respectable e-sport with millions of player around the world. She responded: "I know. I was talking about TL, they're trash."
with an ac of 130 he shouldn't have gotten hit at all.
Ziggs is so obnoxious
You value an entertaining game but can't take a joke
I am familiar with smurfing. I'm sure we'll have some problems, which is why we will heavily penalize it and do our best to deter it.

Also, lower divisions have smaller prize pools, so smurfing in the league isn't that advantageous.
CLG making GGS look good, though
LMFAO
The damage was done way before this game and the draft and gameplay was awfull they draf rek and renek broxah be top side the first 10 min of the game you know trundle will be there you need a winning renek
My personal theory is that their mental just boomed after all of the visa issues and the straw that broke the camel's back was doublelift getting sick into his benching.
I'd like to see Hauntzer on TL...see how he would do with Broxah/Jensen.
Exactly. My auto range is less than one of the midlaners three dashes how the fuck do I kite it.
Doublelift thrives on those scenarios. Need 87 different things to happen to get a chance at a tiebreaker to get out of groups, the 87 things happen, and then loses the tiebreaker anyway.

Ah, okay.
What? Travis says he redos interviews if the interviewee doesn’t like what they said in their previous one so that Travis doesn’t spread unnecessary drama or misinformation to the public. You stating this tells me you’d rather have a journalist that creates articles and videos for clickbait.
Now there's a new timeline where we beat, c-9 tomorrow, imt loses twice while gg wins twice, we win the 3 way tie and then still win the split.
 Diana isn't a mage. She is kind of an assassin. LB is also an assassin. That leave only 4 mages which is just them because really good. For example TF is always strong but that's mostly because of his ult.
Ik reddit has the memory of a goldfish but let me remind all of those who forget every 6 months. 


#TANKS WILL NEVER BE GOOD IF THEY DON'T DO DAMAGE

It is the nature of this game.  They need to clear minions, they need to have kill pressure in lane, they need to be able to zone enemies, they need to be able to take towers. 


Unless Riot manages to add a champion that can delete minion waves from existence and has repeatable global taunt, everything above is true.
He played pretty bad in the loss vs TSM, missed a lot of skillshots and made questionable decisions, but that's basically his only bad game.  
The 1.75m dollar man is a total stud.
When did Flyquest pick up Solo?
Sometimes you just fellatio your way to the top, hes so fking smug on hotline league whenever he talks about his career too. "I went to LCS and was watching from the press room" as if the press room is anything more then him and some riot folks.
When Eternals wasn’t a thing.
i dont understand wtf they were doing with their first Baron. They were pushing mid and bot instead of doing top and bot as to split the enemy team further apart. Then they got the bot inhib to about 1/4 and just backed off instead of trying to press their advantage. 

poor macro play all around
We need to stop blaming the drafts at some point. Even if we lost the draft, that game was clearly in TSM's hands after their first baron and they threw it hard.

Also,forgot the "get fcked biatch" part😂😅 

I think that's maybe one of the best reactions in a lol game,maybe even comparable to the recent fall of yankos when the game ended😂
If by "excuse" you mean "explanation," they aren't cards in a card game that only get played once. It's the same "excuse" as 5 weeks ago. Nothing changed. They don't need a new reason for losing if the old reason is still true.

He's good if you have proactive players, not wards
IMO they should change lifesteal so that it is buffed when fighting champions but heavily nerfed on minions and monsters. Out of combat healing shouldn't be so strong and uncounterable. It's kind of like giving Ryze a way to just head into the jungle and get a refill of his mana bar at any jungle camp. That way, grevious wounds would actually counter lifesteal.
oof and TSM was supposed to have toxic fans lol
If NA could stop playing Trundle and Renekton. Teams never win becasue of those picks, just drag those useless champs all game.
I'd trade good support and early updates for good ping with shitty support and late updates. Anything higher than 100 ms really bothers me and it's not even competitive because I am just a casual player. It's just really uncomfortable for me.

Though yes, their support is basically non-existent. I tried asking to change my username several times through the years (I've been playing since season 3) and I never even got a reply.
>Ryoma’s teamfighting has gotten much cleaner, but Bjergsen really rocked him in lane

They were actually surprisingly even, ignoring the few fights were Bjergsen got some kills early. They were only like 20 cs apart 30 minutes into the game, which is nothing when Cody Sun got funneled all the minions they could give him. 

Ryoma has been growing a lot more than people give him credit for.
/r/GirlGamers has a pretty big Discord, a couple thousand members or so. I don't hang out there that often so idk how popular cs is there, but it might be worth a try.

You cant really play Taric if you're not shotcalling the fights because then you look like Core and all of your ults land about 3 seconds late.

not true, back in 2016-2017 the level of play in NA was actually pretty high, after 2018 it started regressing severely to where we are now.

edit: forgot about Summer 2014, probably the most competitive NA split ever. No one was the favorite going into playoffs that split and the games were nuts.

It's easy to blame draft when you give up Aatrox, Syndra, Xayah and Rakan in exchange for one top tier pick in Zoe.

Yes we do
That's BALLS
Ironically, Doublelift has been by far the best player on the team the past few weeks.
If we look at the 7 games of Renekton this season, the stats tell a different story. One of those wins was against fucking CLG, which was an absolute shitstomp in every lane irrespective of picks. One of those wins was when Impact troll picked Zac and got hard stomped in lane, as he would have by any meta toplaner. Neither of those games is a win based on Renekton as a champion, or showcases how he can benefit a team. 

There are only two (2) games this season that took advantage of Renektons early game power to carry. 100T vs DIG where Ssumday once again dragged the corpses of his team to a win, and EG vs IMT where Soaz abused Ornns weak early games.
Bjerg It Out
kobbe looks so average though. 

90% games he's just there to get carried. part of it is playstyle with tsm looking to play through bb mostly. role players are nice and all but with tsms ambition being to do well at worlds you need threats in all lanes and they don't play well with bb on weak side/kobbe on strong side. Like imagine this tsm going up against some powerhouse teams like they're bound to face at worlds, like ig or g2. They just get rolled imo.

bb/kobbe/coaching staff are things to look at for tsm and in that order as well  if things don't go well in summer/worlds.
Does it actually? I know the casters said so, but I think the Cinderhulk passive always damages around the champion, not the object that cc's. I think it's more likely that it procced brittle and the kill gets attributed to the one that procced it.
C9 used to be the only NA team that performs internationally. Now they are the only NA team that performed domestically and internationally.
Thank you very much! \^-\^

Don't type to me again if you can't learn to form meaningful and comprehensible sentences
In pro play, sure, since his kit has so many things that flourish in pro play. But 99% of the people complaining about him are not referring to his pro play performance. Not just that, but there are other champions that have similar mechanics that aren't good due to the fact that they must be balanced around these mechanics and thus the rest of their kit is gated by this (since these champions, like Zoe, are eventually nerfed into the dirt). Most of the people here are just complaining because Ornn comboed them for a shit load of damage which is exactly what he was doing when they changed him and he was god awful for like a year despite that.
If an ADC missplays massively in the late game, they should die. It's not hard for Xayah to survive in this situation.
Wow that went horrible for CLG
Here is your Streamable mirror link! https://streamable.com/sqizt
He spends 3 months off every single year during the off season, 5 if he doesn't make worlds, and another every time he didn't make MSI. Stop making excuses lmaooo

Yea if you put yourself in dl's place. Its really fucking hard to keep on trying at this point. He won 4 trophies in the lcs in a row but still couldnt get out of groups. But then suddenly new season comes and your jungler cant play because visa issues, your team starts running it down, your coaches still draft like its season 9 but without the sona taric. 

Its so hard to come back with motivation to actually win a split. They dont seem to have a good enough coaching staff that could help the team with burnout like g2 with the perkz caps swap to keep the game fresh and fun for the players. Truly a feels bad moment

I'd say it's more of a combination of factors outside of the game that may have contributed to it. Having to scrim with pobelter in the jg before the split, shernfire showing up a week before the split, broxah showing up four weeks into the split, doublelift getting sick, doublelift getting benched and then brought back the same weekend as the coaches panicked and took back their attempt at a power move on doublelift, and then COVID-19 essential making all of the players play remotely. It just seems like tl had way too much to deal with so I definitely don't blame them for not performing up to expectations. 

Beyond that, though, impact and doublelift just had bad splits. Even then, if they had decent drafts they might still be in playoffs.
Didn’t tsm have Johnson last year? Why not keep him? He looks better than kobbe
Many teams around the world are prioritising Renekton. It’s obviously a really strong pick from scrims. 

TL fans: fucking shit coaches picking Renekton
Veni, Vidi, Vici
How do I kite these champs that have 3 dashes and cc and flash and I have flash
This roster can't be allowed to fail. Fire the entire coaching staff, they clearly did a shitty job with what they were given.
> Team Dark got banned from OGN for trolling.

Wasnt that senario them getting pissed at something and trolled hard in a game that had an impact on the standing? This game however did not change the standing one bit.

>Also this could be seen as match fixing for the betting market.

I have seen this argument show up at the end of splits. This is a common thing that happens at the end of splits. Hell I only tuned in today because I expected Fnatic and G2 to do troll games, which means there is no sign of match fixing because it's expected. Also afaik Riot has never endorsed or show any signs of thinking of match betting which means they have no reason at all to take that into account.
Do you accept trans?
impact has always been bad.
This happened to me, put in a ticket to riot support
Fnatic and Vitality was insanely troll, and is not anything you should go by. 

Nemesis played midlane Graves, building Spirit Visage and Liandrys. Nothing of value was gained from that game.

Edit: other than tons of fun and laughs, obviously.
RIP, I do not expect you to survive.
Impact needs to be replaced in summer
ya that was 100% on him. sitting here watching it like wtf man just go over the wall
Can we get a Doublelift 1v5 C9 showmatch
  "Mages are really strong atm and can definitely do just as much as a fed tank/bruiser "

Strong tanks can splitpush, putting your team in a 4v3. In most cases a midlaner will lose a 1v1 against a carry split push bruiser mid-late game.

" This constant oscillation is what keeps the game novel and fun "

I don't ever recall anyone since s3 say that in general bruisers are weak. Not much has changed.

There are so many more memories of a bruiser heavily carrying a game than an ap midlaner.

The top 20 highest winrate champs (according to [u.gg](https://u.gg) plat+) are \~60% bruisers.

The solution to this is complex.
If C9 chokes and loses playoffs again, I can fully see Licorice just saying fuck it and leaving. They're winning now, but until they're actually lifting the trophy, it's still a possibility.
insane clg synergy as usual
A wild lemon appears!
Cuzz and Peanut were splitting time in 2018 lmao


Cuzz was better in spring, Canyon was better in summer. Canyon was still pretty overrated and it showed when he played against tougher competition at worlds
Or you can get rid of Broxah and Core and get Dardoch, Ssumday, Biodaddy and seend Broxah and Core to TSM for Dardoch BioDaddy and free up money to get Ssumday.
What would DL do? Go stream? 

Impact I can see getting benched for summer. He's just been running it down all split and he can barely play anything meta anymore during the season.
Impact has become intpact
For CLG, not for Broxah
But who are you? Your opinion is far more irrelevant, sorry.
That's really not true. He's a rock in playoffs and international tournaments (debatable) but in regular split this guy has mostly been below average with like one split where he was actually good.
> They gave the same advice listed earlier

this sucks, third party resellers are charging some extra bucks
I think C9 would have good matches in LEC against any team that isn't G2.

But the rest of NA looks broken after last worlds.  Hopefully things shape up.
Watch Dig beat IMt today to get TL's hopes up and then full int vs TSM to knock out TL.
E: maybe GGS also win today and then play Keith ADC tomorrow.

Kobbe is better than Doublelift. Both are worse than Zven. And i dont think Zven would rejoin TSM so...
He has mechanics that literally break the core rules of the game. It’s fucking OP in pro play.

Just upgrading his own items gives him the equivalent of 10 kills. I’m not exaggerating.
what is that build lol

and how are you winning
lmao, what was the thought process here?
I think they turn red at the end of the duration
Where else will he go
Wait, it empowers CC?
Wish we could bench impact and broxah. But we can't because they need to have motivation issues first.

Pls get a new coach. At least for drafting. Hell have parth draft for all I care.

How can you give up ornn two games in a row and get nothing in return?
Thats because poe dont want to be proactive pre 1 first items and solo want to smash lane and bot lane is all about ignar roaming now they have a better early gameplay camp top early play around mid later
I think that dyrus gtfo my lane happened in bot lane
The return of the notorious POO
Besides C9 and TSM once nobody in NA leave groups anyway, if you look at the context he is playing in, he has reached greatness imo.

Then again it depends whats your definition of greatness, but if Doublelift didn't reach it, who in NA did?

Jensen can’t show synergy when he doesn’t leave lane. Every top team in the world all has high roaming mids who sacrifice lane and cs for helping their team out elsewhere, Jensen just sits in lane farming and doesn’t die. His playstyle is just so shit and he’s ridiculously out of touch with the meta. I don’t know if this is Jensen’s fault or the coaching telling him to play this way, but it’s atrocious

Slows never stack, the strongest one is applied.

do you have any understanding about how smurf accounts work?
Playing a champ that only exists inside lane.
He may be one of the worst midlaners and one of the easiest to predict but I don't think he's unplayable
pobelter getting solokilled by goldenglue LOL he needs to retire after this
I actually don't think DL is a passive till items player I just think Core and DL don't mesh at all in lane. Core gets a lot of hype for being a worlds winner and honestly he should Core is a great player but he doesn't mesh with DL. DL had so much more success with Biolift and Aphroo who are both worse than Core now why is that? It's because Aphroo and Bio can keep up in lane and make plays Core honestly feels like he goes missing sometimes.

Also, Yeah Jensen is such a hard person to have synergy with because he plays the game too basically he makes everything extremely obvious when he's getting a gank.

Impact is and has been the worst player on TL even with Xmithies blunders at worlds. I don't know what they will do honestly.

The more I think about the more I realize TSM is the perfect fit for DL they would only need to get Ssumday top and they might actually be the best team NA has ever created. Seeing a roster of Ssumday, Dardoch, Bjerg, DL, Bio makes me go crazy as much as I hate TSM lol.
Very descriptive.
I thought i was done watching clown games with the lec. But then this happens.
It would be the third time DL replaces him
Renekton has a 57% Winrate (-todays games) in NA... The idea that a champions performance in other games would be relevant is stupid anyway. But if that‘s how you think teams should approach the Draft then Renekton is a perfectly fine pick.
That's the kind of quarantine content we all need
Half asses and still 2nd best player on the team. The thing is that he'd look a lot better if Core, Impact, and Broxah weren't either running it down or doing nothing at all.
Lol you deserve gold. Gimme 7.5hrs. I'm broke.
**Here's how it breaks down:**

Division A: Diamond 4 - Challenger 1  
Division B: Gold 3 - Platinum 1  
Division C: Bronze 4 - Gold 4

Players have to link their League of Legends accounts to their Discord account when they join the league so that will help prevent any funny business.

Hopefully that helps ease your concerns.

One of our admins (me) spams csgo and would love some grills that plays it too. This server is mainly for league of legends but she's still welcome ofcourse
Technically DL hasn’t played the whole split though.
So they should look to improve on the broadcast and fill the time slot with content, versus dead space. They could do that by having largely audio based content, like the analyst desk, so they can have content you can enjoy while doing the things you previously mentioned. I'm not sure what was unclear there. Let me know if you have further questions.
Hire more C9 players, actually give Reapered a blank check.
>And Impact got cheesed this game.

Every game, apparently. Impact has been one of the worst performing top laners in LCS this entire split, and have had, what, a single decent game? Everything else has been awful.
Clash was at an earlier time today. I don't know if Riot told people and I just didn't see, but I'm pretty annoyed. I've played league every day this week, and just didn't look at the times. I just assumed it was the exact same time as every other clash that there has ever been.
100T choked both maps lol
DL has won so many splits, MSI Finals, he alone is bigger than C9. NA is such a joke, even memeing your most iconic player. DL despite currently being off-form is bigger than the entire C9 Org in League. Besides, C9 would have gotten murdered even harder than TL in that Group last year. At least TL took a Game off of DWG there, C9 would have never been able to do that in a million years
amen.
No other team in LCS right now is even half as good as 2016 IMT, and they never made finals.
If they were truly coordinated, they’d each be responsible for a particular direction just slightly around the target - NSEW and center. That should, in theory, guarantee hits.
He said it on stream actually
Don't worry they'll turn it around when Broxah gets here and Shernfire isn't playing
Reapered weird draft's is a thing but tl  with troll draft's is new
The tentacles all look like they're head banging
ok the problem with your comment and your "just trying to have friends" comment is: if you just need friends, why did you say only male server? Certainly anyone regardless of gender could be your friend then, so why specifically male only? Without the context, it comes off as incredibly sarcastic as in "oh why do girls get this special server but not guys?" 

And if you're really looking for only guys to be your friends, dude any league discord is going to have like 95-5 guy to girl ratios. Just find any random discord and start from there.
Double is honestly playing fine tho. He isn’t playing his best, but that doesn’t matter when YOUR top die every 5 min and ur mid is afk farming the whole game, even though all the top teams both in NA and worldwide have high roaming mids who sacrifice lane.
Yea doublelift definitely deserves criticism for what he's said this split but goddamn this is frustrating to watch.
Nah. S7 is better.
Ah, so if only G2 had had your infinite wisdom and recognized Jankos as the best player in the world and gave him pick/ban priority, everything would've been different? You know better than his own team then, congratulations. Lmao get a grip on reality mate.
the player association only has so much power as riot allows them to. their vote wasnt binding in any way. It was just a message to riot.
Yeah, all those stats being propped up by the LPL who are mechanically so much better than NA teams it's not even funny.

NA Jayce was a thing for a reason. NA Renekton is very much a thing.
Impact looked like he was getting cheesed all split long.
Good. He's invisible in all the games anyways. I dont think I see a difference between broxah and a plat jungler. Both equally make 0 plays.
It uses the ingame live client api to get the player stats (health/mana) :) sorry about that, the comments I meant probably were in the previous post.
Thank you.
Sweeper doesnt "allow" it. Its a permanent thing, you can instakill wards right as the enemy soraka places them if you are nearby.
At th estart of the split Dl was the main shotcaller. The split started hard and became harder. DL was benched (meaning that he may have been seen as the problem for TL) then returned but was denied the shotcalling responsibility. 

Since broxah is good at following gameplan but not at creating / adapting (source bwipo interview), it leaves either impact corejjj or jensen. It's probably corejjj.
Cuzz didnt even play in season 8 so how can you include him in this conversation? and if we’re talking about season 9, Canyon was far far better than Cuzz. it’s pretty clear you don’t watch lck at all
Core was bad earlier in the split but started picking up week 5ish


And yeah Jensen was great basically until the last 2-3 weeks. DL has been pretty good since he came back but a little too late

From what I can tell this is completely true. 

Impact has been losing lane by a large margin and has almost never made any global plays

Broxah is a follower, not a leader, his past teammates have even said this, so he looks afk on a bad team

Jensen seems tilted, farming and not really doing anything proactive

Core is hard to tell, hes been utility picks most of the split

Doublelift said what everyone was thinking, "spring doesn't matter" and gets blamed for everything above
Lol if this happened in some streamers game like iwd/T1 you just know they'd be seeing red and raging like monkeys at this soft inting. Like what the fck this is actually so funny holy shit.
Jensen has been doing great this split, he should hold 1v1 on Nisqy just fine. Botlane should be little C9 favored. Jungle obviously in favor of C9, but top? lmao
Dude right? I don't get why everyone is hyping up Cody so much that game was 100% ssumday
He hasn’t looked good on tanks this split, and last year he would absolutely pop off. He was top 3 last year in top lane. Idk what happened to him this split but the whole team just looks off.
Impact has had so many troll games. Let's not make excuses for him.
So good!!!!!! Love it!!
They nerfed her passive heavily lol
I know. Im just saying he could be even more powerful later on. I can see how it could be interpreted as flaming. That wasnt the intention :)
yea just remove the bonus dmg and make ornn a absolute bottom of the barrel trash tier champ great idea

>Tenacity exits, brittle should be the counter to it

who said that? you? sry but you are just some rando on reddit why would this matter?

>instead we have hyper tanks 2 shoting carries from off the screen.

we dont
Because that's how squishies are supposed to play around telegraphed slow abiltiies?
With the amount of money invested into this roster, I have my doubts that they will continue with this line up.

Personally, I think Impact and Doublelift (atleast) will be leaving TL.
I don’t want no Lucian viktor flashbacks
C9 draft were always a 50/50, fly and eg have the best draft so far this split
The man is a god!
And to be fair we'd probably be comparing them to Season 3 Cloud 9 anyways if we're talking most dominant.
It's not even competitive. It's just super uncomfortable for me. Maybe you got used to it but I also tried playing at 200+ ms when I tried to play at NA server, shit feels like I have training weights on.
Remember folks Travis is a journalist but only when his friends say he can be.
no it doesnt?
> Yes, thats what im saying.
He has done angry interviews before but i guess you wherent here since the early days of league (Check CLG and TSM)
He wasnt benched for sure but arguing this split tell me when he was the problem ?

????



> but arguing this split tell me when he was the problem ?



Type better
Just watch male adc mains infiltrate their ranks to get supports everygame.

Brb, unrelated
how is he not ok?
how well did that work out?
god so brilliant！
kite.
I think people also expect to have to dodge in all for one since all 5 of the enemy have the same ability, so players are more hyper focused on dodging
Honestly, I don't think so. They are wasting either Tactical, DL or Rikara's time with that.
Are George Foreman's allowed in your discord.
So basically, Impact is shit.
What about a trusted moderator that could receive the pictures, or maybe something like a drivers license that has their gender on the card and can white out the unimportant things with a timestamp written on a paper next to the card? This is a cool idea but there needs to be restricts and verification if it's going to work. There are going to be a ton of trolls who see this and are going to join to intentionally try to destroy the discord now.
GMT +1 I think, cuz that's when I have lags too
Uhhhh what? Do you just say stuff and hope it sounds good or something? Of course ram matters? Other things also matter though, which is what I feel like you meant to say
Impact just following social distancing rules
except that ornn isnt problematic atm and nerfing his dmg even more would just make him irrelevant
We've had some guys troll in VC to get in, it was pretty entertaining
I actually believe Jensen was trying the whole time, and I'm sure Shernfire was doing his best in a very tough spot but yeah Impact was taking the split off while just keeping his mouth shut about it and CoreJJ was not doing any better than DL either from what I could see.
You need to separate theshy from the champ theshy can make warwick top look busted ( ornn is still busted)

Nah I don’t think it’s ever been this bad tbh. Even in the c9, TSM and Immortal dominant regular season splits, it always felt like there was at least one team that might be able to challenge them in playoffs
because I'm looking at the past 2 years where Broxah was actually relevant and not a complete rookie in the scene?
All the people in here like "lole just play perfectly" "lel just kite"

&#x200B;

clearly you havent played adc recently.
Never mind, CLG vs GG both had even worse drafts. How are drafts this fucking bad right now?
I'm sorry you're confusing reasons with 'excuses'. Having Lee Sin in a skirmish heavy meta where you're always stronger in 2 v 2s and 3v2s is literally the reason. One match does not determine whether you're a better or worse player.
Make it rain
You didn't answer this anywhere, as far as I can tell.
yeah, Impact would be allowed to have a troll game if DL didn't int on senna 4 games in a row.  If somehow the postseason narrative warps TL's failure to be all Impact's fault, it's a grave injustice.
Can’t believe they gave Ornn/Aphelios away again.
True. Unless papa jack is a merciful God.

Oh, is that one of the new training things? Or is it just one champion for the entire team? How do you do that?
dont think he will get that many good offers from eu.
I wasn't planning to watch much Lol today, but now I have to see if GGS and Dig can win for the impossible TL come-back, or if both bust like crazy to throw even more salt on the wound.
[its even funnier than I remember](https://youtu.be/rrgCoWBl4r8)
what? where is this coming from lol


it doesn't matter when you win worlds unless you're playing at the EXACT same level/style that you were when you won it. And Core/Impact/Baolan clearly aren't
Cody Dad
This is acctually a great display off what Doublelift said. I know he got a good amount of flame for his words and he shouldnt say it cuz its a Team issue. In this Replay tho u see there is no real synergy, there is no call its pure Soloq mentality.
Broxah always play early cham and they dont want to be agressive early makes not sense.
DL was his worst player this player second worst impact, jensen and Core were the best of tl
Impact vs Sword is the real question.
Leash dragon for Santorin to smite steal and saved his life.
What happened to Broxah? Was there a mandatory castration he had to undergo in order for his visa to go through?
God I've seen better lux play in a salty teemo game

Well even if all the other cards fall right for TL, they would still have to beat C9 tomorrow. Not gonna happen.

> That's not entirely true, if Riot wanted, they could stop them from  doing it, it's Riot-s intelectual property, they can force changes if  they want. 

That would require an amount of motivation to go through a ton of legal battles in order to get out of a profitable situation just because a company has questionable ethics. If you think Riot has that kind of motivation then you do you, but they certainly haven't shown it yet.

DL and Jensen with no flash and their only hope is to have someone apply any form of pressure. Legit it would not matter if renetkon was bugged and couldnt do any dmg. Impact just had to be a meat shield to buy Jensen and DL two or three seconds.

I'm not a TL fan but god damn when watching impact stayed in the pit doing nothing while trundle escape with 100 hp... fuck dude.

Good chat.
Yeah, his W does it
What? I'm not discounting the win, I'm saying it has been a long time since they won it so it's hard to say "they won worlds 7 and 3 whole years ago respectively, so they're obviously playing at the same level now"
What you meant to say was DL isn't being carried by Xmithie anymore.
They still has Smeb and Score which you’d think should be enough just to reach playoffs or at least not look like shit
One of few comments here that actually recognizes great play, sup diff was big this game
There is absolutely no way TL sticks with broxah* 

He’s invisible
And look what happened. Culture change. They are in a winning mindset now finally. Sneaky was the problem when it came to this because every loss and hard loss was always a team fault rather than individualistic faults. Licorice wanted people to take responsibility as did Nisqy so they could improve individually which in turn would improve the team play.
ah easy.

This may have been their funniest cast. Had my dying all game
naut?
They fined Dignitas and (god I’m getting old, I forgot) for playing an ARAM and agreeing to split the prize money back in the day. I wanna say season 2 or 3? Before ARAM had its own map and gamemode. 

Obviously it’s different, but the idea of ‘no deals/agreements between teams’ is not an outlandish one.
yes they are!
Again I don’t play enough to get BE for champs and I really don’t care in this situation.
Core played awfully this split based on his former level. He escaped a lot of flak but he's been just as bad as everyone else. The only one who has shown some flashes of greatness is Jensen early in the split, and even he fell off hard at the end (DL also seems to be doing ok after being benched fwiw).
Naut and Trundle too
Can you link the foldy sheet
lose DL = extremely risky. Unless they win next season or they'll crash as an org. If DL stays then atleast tl won't lose half the fanbase.
They literally said he got benched, what? 


For 7 straight weeks he was playing poorly (literally bottom 4 ADCs in the league) and kept saying "spring doesn't matter" and clearly didn't want to tryhard. He played well these past 2 weeks but not much time to turn it around then
Oh my bad, didn’t realise you were talking about Doublelift when you said double
> Do you think viper was just a striaght up roleplayer? I

First it starts with the question as above, then it gets built upon as a hypothesis until the magic of Griffin is further reduced to say just Tarzan / Chovy.
The TSM special. It's their smart marketing strategy. How do they fuck up this one? Find out at the end of the video !!!
Please teach me how to live for 10 seconds.
Impact wanst inting every game they draf are awfull and DL was his worst player this split
They should build rilays on each xerath, you hit one ult, you hit them all.
As far as I know you can't display the champion name over the champion. But if you hold open the scoreboard with tab and hover over the icon it should say the champion name there.
TSM and TL working together to make sure TL won’t make playoffs
runaans hit varus, not cody
Oh please, shut the fuck up.

Doublelift has been getting more than enough criticism, something he actually deserves this time around. Dude really just needs a PR agent at this point imo.

But TL's problems go beyond a single player and DL isn't alone in that regard.

Just a really poor split from TL overall. I personally hope they take a hard look at themselves after this split and think about where they want to go from here. Personally, I'd be pretty fucking angry if they go into the summer split with the same shit mindset and continue to play like apes. No reason for them to be underwhelming both individually and as a team when the only teams in NA that have improved this year is C9 and TSM. All the other teams and their players more or less have stayed the same.

All in all, just a really shitty split for NA LCS. I don't even know why I hold out hope at this point the league gets better because so far this Spring, it actually looks like they've regressed.

Always ready with the excuses. If Jankos was "the best player in the world", which he isn't, he wouldn't get absolutely shit on for three games in a row just because of pick priority, and I think you know that.
Hold tab and hover over their icon it tells you the champ and skin
If you actually read what I posted, you'd see I'm comparing the gameplay to ranked.  It transfers over.  Idgaf about a random fun game mode.  But the exact same plays I see in said modes and norms carries over to ranked.  Seemed like I hit a sore button for you and you ended up not understanding.  But please, keep flaming the guy who is voicing out an opinion mr, "keyboard warrior".
They can get away with it because people keep spending money on it.
They wont. A playoff team wont pay millions to downgrade going into summer split
Yeah, this alone will make it impossible to win. 

It is insane that Impact somehow turned into one of the absolutely worst top laners in LCS this split. All consistency gone, loses every side of every matchup, and so often just randomly runs it down for no reason. Bwipo was coinflippy, sure, but Broxah was used to a toplaner who won *sometimes*, and lost somewhat gracefully. Must really feel terrible to get to TL and see such an insane downgrade across all the roles.
Every play that went TL's way was DL starting the fight with ult. Not saying his shotcalling would have won them the game but maybe they would have done stuff
Doesn't matter. Unless GP does very weird stuff, they can't really dive him. Meanwhile, he scales super hard, can waveclear and snowballs bot even harder with his ult. TL botlane wins, and Aatrox getting more ressources doesn't compensate that. Aatrox isn't gonna be able to match Kallista+Taric any time, even fed. With GP, you also don't run into the issue of getting outscaled into oblivion (as seen with Rene being a minion).
If you're looking for supports that are fun I would suggest Senna and Brand. 

I personally think yuumi is one of the funnest champs in league atm but it's more of an acquired taste.
Thanks was trying to flash the moment I saw thresh hook and ult them.
yay, 100T on playoffs again, its been so long
I'm not making definitive statements though, most of them are pretty general or stating what happens in most teams when it comes to drafting (which has been said by pros, coaches, etc. in the past).


And even that is fine, it's fine to make assumptions because we don't know shit as fans. But it's still not fair to shit on coaches without the relevant info. 



Anyway, EG/TSM have pretty good players all around and neither of them really know how to draft either. Reapered seems to have a lot of control in drafting at C9 and I don't think I have to remind you of how many times C9 fans have flamed him for his drafts. 



I agree TL should be making playoffs regardless but when a team this stacked misses playoffs, it isn't just down to coaching (which is where too much of the blame is being put)

DL is not a passive player. How many times has he hard smashed his lane over the two years?
I think the problem is not having a clear second place team so there’s no one to judge them against. It just ends up being c9 and then the rest of the teams fighting over who is the least shit
CLG broxah could be decent
fuck that impact tweet. feel bad now
Didn't Licorice also want to leave C9 at some point? I remember a lot of rumors in the pre-season about Licorice wanting to dip C9 before they got rid of Zeyzal and Sven. Something about C9 not being serious enough to win.

C9 are the only NA team to do well internationally, I have high expectations this year with their huge botlane upgrade, and surprising jungle upgrade. I genuinely think they play the game in a way that makes them a real threat to any team on any given day.
They force a two bad plays in mid game fly always int in the around late early and early mid game and they become a top coming into late game
Yeah I feel bad for Broxah too :( , a hard split for him, hope they can make this roster work for next split.
you have the wrong brackets, swap those around, friend.
Imagine if C9 somehow dont win the most free split in years. Licorice is peacing out faster than G2 can lock in Sejuani
You think the LCK would take the worst top laner in NA? LMFAO, he's done.

Actually reminds me of EU superteam Elements not making playoffs. They won summer split playoffs in season 4 (as Alliance) and then got seventh place in spring split 2015.
Baolan won a championship in 2018, do you want him starting on TL ? lol
The real loser is TL
I enjoyed that observer only viewed Licorice \*after\* he got to his destination and then just stood there.
the fucking brand comment.
The thing is that Jensen and Doublelift have been the best players on TL this split. Core's inted here and there, while Impact and Broxah have been absolute hot garbage.
yea I heard that on the desk, seems very unlikely as either as DIG plays IMT and TSM, and GG play CLG and FQ. Crazy how hard they've fallen, as a C9 fan I wanna see them smash TL tomorrow just to cement locking them out
Tbh a lot of them earned that money already for TL. DL, Impact deserve their payments for being the faces of TL. DL is their big market.
Even a silver Renekton ult up would just run into them mashing QWE and do better than this
Ahh, I see. Thanks.
They do mesh really well together, but the one that clearly stands out is Blaber and this game was a good example of it. 9 times of 10 Nisqy is following Blaber's lead and not the other way around. Blaber makes plays all around the map without Nisqy while Nisqy virtually never makes plays around the map without Blaber and rarely outright wins his own lane.
So Xmithie really was the glue that held this team together, huh?
*roll Doublelift taking out the trash commercial*
its a game mode. one for all
I didn't even realise this but, Bwipo bought zhonias
what? if anything DL has been one of the best laners in NA.

Holy shit we suck
First rotation your top laner Teemo so you don't waste last pick on him.
Relevant flair lmfao
Someone needs to make a meme compilation of Impact for this spring split. It'll be hilarious
I've only ever complained about this season and last season.

Every heard the term "assumption" ? 

 You wont hear shit from me about next season because most of the problems that I actually care about *should* be fixed. If not then I'll have given up on Riot and not care anyway lol.
If GG 2-0, IMT 0-2, TL 1-1, and TL wins tiebreakers, they can still win. There is 4 results on the foldy sheet in which they are in a tie for 6th that isn't automatically resolved by H2H.
Hmm hmm yes
Yes, Tian "dumpster-ed" Jankos in a 5 v 5 game by having the complete priority in pick and bans. lol. You must be the well known expert.
If GG 2-0, IMT 0-2, TL 1-1, and TL wins tiebreakers, they can still win. There is 4 results on the foldy sheet in which they are in a tie for 6th that isn't automatically resolved by H2H.
its still not the issue with the team

lets say Cain 100% has control of drafts (which he doesnt) the team still plays like shit in game. They lack communication and leadership in game. That is not the coach's fault.

They will replace Cain and still have the same problem next split
Normally in these situations (see G2 vs MSF) both teams go for quite trolly picks and plays. What happened here happens more or less every split, and this time maybe Vitaly wanted to go for a win seeing how their split has gone this season. So I think they are fine with what happens. They know Fnatic wasnt really trying but the win should still feel good for them, fnatics draft must have been horrible to play against.
Cloud9: Are we a joke to you!?
C9 can def do well internationally. They just need to scrim and practice the other teams before the competitions.

I’m happy that TL didn’t make playoffs. No TL playoff magic finally. Plus we get to see a new winner.
Stealing a paycheck
Darius, Garen, and Morde would be right up your alley. All very easy and braindead to play and can win or go even in most lanes without really knowing matchups
ur giving them a LOT of credit there
He has never been benched before either

He has never done an angry interview with Travis (or the recent one that came out that was top of this sub) before he was kicked from the team either. 


Things change lol


Being kicked from 2 teams is also a pretty small sample size
I never said it didn't.
If he has balls he could try Europe. But pretty much no way he would ever make top 3 there.
Only reason TL is even in the LCS is because they bought Doublelift to save them from relegation.
They should keep tactical
This is so beautiful. The despicable import team that threw millions of dollars at taking a dump on NA's integrity as a region can't even make playoffs. Good riddance to TL. I'm only sad that they won as many games as they did. Hopefully DL gets an NA team around him next split so he can pop off.
Can’t believe Broxah left EU for this...
Try to play aganist Ahri,or assasins aganist tanks
Wrong.   
He said he wanted to change and he did.  
He played all the new champs but his team is inting left and right before he can do anything.  
Gets solo killed by a low tier bot lane but it can happen to anyone. Zven was dying last 2 years to everyone including cannon minions, bang as well.  
People need to get off DL's ass.   
Even fucking pro players and coaches of the likes of Grabs said that they understand why DL said he was burned out.  


But no, you on reddit, behind your chair know more then the players you worship.
Fresh out of the pasta pot
It's google chrome. Try other web browsers or league+

that what made  me sure that  TL  doesnt  deserve playoffs  spot  i was  hoping they can get  one  due to broxah  is new and all but the  team have  some serious  issues hopefully they can solve them
The funny part is that he's actually had fantastic laning stats. There are a lot of games where he's arguably overperforming relative to his counterpart and the team's resource allocation. But when he's bad, he's fucking terrible.
That's what c9 fans thought about Impact and Jensen, but too many 0s on a paycheck can change a man.
975BE 195RP, looking at the page right now
Ssumday, Licorice and Impact have shared best Top NA at different points since 2018. Ssumday for Spring 2018, Licorice for Summer 2018 and Spring 2019, Impact for Summer 2019. In all that time Impact has barely been dominant at all since the "top die" days of 2016.
fucking doublelifts motivation getting impact solo killed, UGH ffs bring in tactica. /s
With Xmithie they 100% at least make playoffs. The dude is carrying IMT to wins with Eika in the mid lane.
Damn
Unpopular opinions incoming.

TL needs a more proactive mid. Jensen gets leads through CS pretty reliably, but until later in the game, he doesn't do much with his lead. Top mids in other regions roam a lot more, just look at Doinb, Nemesis, or Nisqy. This helps the adv get advantages, and while I think Doublelift is a bit overrated, he's undoubtedly a great adc.

CoreJJ is also great, but I sort of doubt that he is a primary shotcaller. I get that TL tries to have a "democratic" shotcalling style, it doesn't seem like it is working. Doublelift isn't allowed to, and Broxah is known for following what people tell him to do rather than calling plays himself. A shotcalling support could do a lot to turn around the team.
I guess Renekton was winning in scrims lmao. The ultimate jebait.
So weird to still see comments blaming DL when Impact did everything outside of destroying TL's nexus himself this game.
TL didn't hear your memo
They probably would have, DL despite being an ADC always looks good when plays are forced by him. I could definitely see him be a good main shotcaller despite being an ADC
I meant after this season*, I'm sure lots of things will shake around and Doublelift probably doesn't want to stay after getting benched and not even making playoffs (plus the interview he had with Travis before it got taken down, and the recent interview where he said he's not being allowed to "change anything", iirc).
I thought he was Role-playing Drake, hoping that Santorin would smite him on accident. Only reason I can think of that he'd just stutter step in the middle of the pit for the duration of his Ultimate.
Quite sure thats 30% more ass than Impact all season.
> Implying that Blaber and Rascal are willing to leave their #1 teams.

One for all tip: ban Lux every match
I mean you can just look at his health but I guess from all the downvotes it looks like the league community can't and needs someone to point it out for them.

Yo Impact, don't get bodied by these fools.
WEE WOO WEE WOO

ILLEGAL MANEUVER
What G2 "fans" think is completely irrelevant to the point. Jankos is the best player in the world.
Yeah thats what me and my buds thought untill we loaded into a game against shens
Doublelift and Wildturtle fighting for the starting spot would make the storyline complete.
Inting
Never before, when CLG played relegations, it was always from losing the 5th/6th place match when LCS was 8 teams
they need some kind of miracle nonsense with DIG 2-0 and IMT 0-2 i think, and to beat C9 of course
Well yeah, that's a given. 8 wins is already sad enough to make playoffs. 7 wins would be real sad lol.
Whatever you say, random reddit expert. Don't worry, I'm sure we will all see how great Jankos is the next time he gets dumpstered by Tian. Or anyone, really.

What is TL supposed to say
yeah it is a good pick but imo it's not worth to put Jiizuke on it, especially against C9 where they won't really get to go late game unless they smash early hard.
Agree to disagree on mages. Mage itemization is quite strong atm. Zoe, Syndra, Le Blanc, Diana, Kass and TF are all very strong right now. Just look at Masters+ Pick Rates and the corresponding win rates. 

As for ADC's, that is most certainly not the "nature of ADC"'s. It is just the current meta. Plenty of metas in the past have had ADC as the strongest role with the greatest carry potential.
Then goes and does skuttle wtf
I remember back in season 5 when you visited websites that sell smurf accounts they also sold usernames like jax yi etc. I always thought some dude owned those names and never sold any of them
New coaches, tell DLift that if he slacks off again he is getting dropped and losing his contract/$$$
TL bang TL licorice inc
People will continue to tell me Impact is sandbagging and obviously knows how to turn it on when he needs to be clutch.
it's the reddit circlejerk with the whole "motivation" circlejerk at the moment he just criticized the coaching decisions which is fine but people are up and arms and over blowing it saying he's saying his team mates suck.
There's absolutely no way Broxah sticks with TL if they go boom in summer
I could see 100T paying it. Any team that gets him would have a huge boost in popularity
2017 is more recently than SKT has won a world championship, and I doubt anyone would say any single victory of theirs "doesn't mean shit", so I'm not sure what the point of trying to discount Core's win in 2017 is. That being said, everyone on this team leaves much to be desired. Coaching included.
Im looking at the exact frame on the vod. For one it crit, and even then it did only 172 damage to biofrost, 416 to bjerg, and 247 to dardoch. 

Mf ult at that point in the game would have over 2k damage in a cone for a full channel.
Tian, Clid, Xerxe, Jankos, Tarzan. There you go. All of them were far better than for the entire last year.
You're right, should've said they should atleast get out of groups, or not get 3-0'd
There was the deleted Travis interview and then this [one].(https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fprz8k/doublelift_on_tls_ingame_struggles_our_team_has/)
everyone has been monkey-mode except for corejj a lot of the time and jensen most of the time
because it works
Why to teams still pick renekton? It's such a bad champ.
Same. Turned it back on 10 min later to see if they'd started up pre-game chat for the next game... 100T comeback? WTF?
Yup :/
Idk, AP Grag is a good bit of damage and Quinn and Aphelios is a lot of damage. It just seemed like teamfights would be awkward with a Quinn.
I can definitely see that happening. DL in free agency = bidding war, will be pretty exciting to see.
Old swain has a better ult. I'd rather have that sustain than the new one going for the burst.
Bruh last thing we want is Liquid Hoovering up more C9 talent.

He's equally garbage like the rest of the team. Don't pretend like DL has these great games and his team is inting, lol. Stop defending this guy. They're all trash together.
Fly with DoubleLift could be interesting. I know WildTurtle is a huge face of the franchise but he's not been performing great this split.
Considering it shows a consistent trend of mages doing dogshit, it's good enough.
RAM doesn't really matter and says nothing about the computer.

This is a good bait though. Not even G2 fans agree with you. 

You’re completely wrong.
You do when you half ass it and still be the 2nd best performer on the team.
1) it doesn't matter how they played in the past, they all played like shit this split at one point or another (apart from Jensen, even in his bad games he was one of the best players for TL). Impact has had an awful split overall, Core was pretty bad early on in the split but started picking it up around week 5 (but was still nowhere close to his performances in 2019). Broxah got a bit unlucky with the visa stuff but he has been inconsistent this split for sure. Doublelift was also poor early in the split and only really played well these past 2 weeks. 




I can't name 5 junglers that have been better than Broxah? Lmfao


Jankos, Clid, Tarzan, Tian, Cuzz 


Broxah was great in 2018 but pretty average in 2019
So what Riot should do is give her a passive that let's her two shot all wards after level 9. That would let her still be able to clear wards later in the game while being weak early. Then scrap the fucking item.
Jensen missed playoffs 2018 Spring...
Holy shit *everything* is the ADC's fault in this game.

ADC does something monstrously overpowered? "200 YEARS LOL"

Top laner does something monstrously overpowered? "ADC misplayed nice job"
swap out drafting coaches (is it both cain and dodo? just one or the other?) before getting rid of players. today was terrible for impact but geez the champ picks have lost more games than impact has

Oh okay, well i tried. Not sure what karma farming is. Glad i gave good advice, im still relatively new to league so i guess i just wanted to help. : )
You're continuing to be completely wrong by making random assumptions.
DL got benched for Tactical and it wasn't exactly a downgrade.  I don't even know what TL has to do from here, honestly, but they have to do something different.  Just try randomly distributing Academy and LCS players or something?
Trade impact and Doublelift for ssumday and Cody sun.
TSM or EG
Yeah, 2013/ 2014 LCS was really awful format. Glad we have what we have now.
They still can tho

Ooh right, the old school playoffs to relegations, yes, was thinking of it probably
I've been saying for years that TL needs a 6th member Top Laner who can play carry/lane stomper champs. I think Impact may be one of the best tank/non priority top laners in NALCS, but put him on a carry and he goes full ????? mode.
there was an interview where dl said he wanted to shotcall but he wasn’t allowed to or something
true, malph is an embarrassment.
> I think TL loses to flyquest though. and if 100T wins just one game that makes the game between TL and C9 just a glorified scrim. 

&#x200B;

> First of all, there is a decent chance that TL will be eliminated on Saturday so the Sunday game with C9 wont matter for either team. 

Called it.
holy shit impact is so fuking bad
Nasus has literally not changed in the last two years, he is exactly the same and the players who played him haven't drastically changed.

Stop dismissing things without evidence, what exactly the last 2 years has changed to make nasus an OTP champion when he clearly wasn't before?
Sent you a pm
DL played sona and senna despite saying how much he hated it... if it was his decision like you’re saying then I don’t think he’d been playing them champs. Of course the players are going to have a say it what they want to play but it’ll be based on what the coach’s have in mind for the draft
prestige skins are ugly and literally the only reason people get them is because they want to flex
Their only chance is to beat co and for IMT to go 0-2.

But it's pretty impossible
Why do i see that many people sayign DL will leave?  
He has never left a team.   
CLG kicked him  
TSM replaced him

...
Not that I think of, he sure flamed the coaches though.
Ah, didn't know Impact was a resident.
10th, 9th, 8th, 7th.
Most of these teams have just bad players. TL is a team stacked with veteran talent, it shouldn't be a question that they'd make playoffs. 

There's also lots of claims from multiple members about internal issues with team synergy and Doublelift outright shitting on his teams shoes. 

Also, considering none of us work in TL all of our claims are conjecture bud.
No they didn't, CLG made it to playoffs every single split under Doublelift. They also played relegations, because at the time the two teams who lost in quarterfinals played each other to see who was the third team to play relegations. In Summer 2014, CLG lost 3-0 to Curse in quarters (after the infamous Korea bootcamp with Monte as coach) and then lost to Dignitas 3-1, who had previously lost to TSM. They then went to play Curse Academy in relegations and started 0-2 before the reverse sweep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je_9QhJFSR0
And TL still needs to beat C9
Maybe, he clearly has burnout issues
And this happens during one of the most dogshit splits for NA as a whole
That's why they need it to be a 3 way
Tank killer is about the only thing late game ADCs are good for, this is true. The ability to kill tanks isn’t the only metric for scaling though. Jhin scales but have you seen him try to kill a tank? In my recent experience most team fights are decided before an ADC can kill the tank (often even Vayne) unless your team is just steamrolling anyway.
I refuse to believe they're not doing that on purpose
Nah, they played in both. 6th place played in relegations at one point when the league was 8 teams.
\*cry\*
I refuse to believe these players are THIS bad together. Not sure if one of them needs to be swapped out for the team to function again or if a new perspective on the coaching staff is needed(lots of games felt lost in draft IMO), but if Team Liquid keeps everything the same for Summer split I hope they at least have the Breaking Point crew ready to make a sequel.
get ride of impact, trade broxah for santorine.
Not really tbh, a lot of people were still excited for them. Although botlane was a definite downgrade, they kept Smeb+Score and Bdd is certainly an upgrade over Ucal so people thought their topside might actually be stronger...

Smeb completely underperformed though and became a bottom tier toplaner again lol (as did the team as a whole).
NA this split is just very shallow. It's akin to a slightly stronger LMS of old where Flash Wolves (C9) is dominating with a bunch of "maybes" (AHQ et.al). 

I mean, on a good day, a team like TSM or EG can take a Bo1 win, for sure, but they're so inconsistent, there's just no faith in them in their current state to be confident on what team will actually show.  

It's Spring though so a little more time can help some teams like EG who have just been put together very recently.
You might think so, and you probably still think that G2 is the best team in the world, even after they got absolutely humiliated in last year's World's final.
If there's one thing I learned, it's that G2 fans are impervious to reality.
I believe there is a way if TL win tomorrow and some really unlikely losses occur for a 3 say tie for 6th. In a 3 way tie head to head doesn't matter as much. I am not sure tho.
So is your only argument here to support the dumbest champ design in the entire game claim that one fight? Because I hate to break it to you but cody did infact auto varus right after varus flashed into him. You can tell because his infernum explosion comes off of varus. 

I hate aphelios and he was definitely broken the first few weeks he was out but the champ did nothing this game that another adc couldnt have.
They never missed playoffs while Double was on the team. What your probably thinking of is the fact that they played in relegations due to how old playoffs worked when there was only 8 teams.
but kled can never apply grievous wounds to Fiora, because she perma W's his Q.
depends whoever pays the most. Also at his current level nobody would pay the insane buyout he probably has written into his contract
It was like that before Corona too though, the outcome of the games felt random, it was and still is almost impossible to determine who will win based on team strengths and draft.
Can you imagine TheShy vs Impact in impacts current state? Lmfao.
Welcome to LCS where everyone beats everyone and in the end C9 chills at worlds
I was referring to double missing playoffs playing whole split.
Greatness of never making it out of groups? 

Or greatness of not making playoffs with the highest paid western roster of all time?
> Have a feeling that DL will end up leaving after this split too

Big doubts, where would he go? C9 is certainly not gonna take him, TSM seems content with Kobbe although i guess not completely impossible, WT is FLY's franchise player and all the other teams except EG maybe are a downgrade even if TL is playing like shit right now and its highly unlikely that one of the bottom tier teams will get a completely new (good) team between the splits.

Even if he tried to get imported into the LEC you have the same situation where FNC and G2 are not gonna take him and then everything else he has left has as good chances of making worlds as TL
Toxic of him to state the obvious.
Do you actually believe that? :D
Going for the biggest CC of all, death.
Only losing tiebreakers
Even more than that, but his whole attitude this entire split has been absolute ass, only a step above Forgiven. He starts off by saying spring doesn't matter, doesn't practice new champs like senna, and plays awfully. Then, Broxah comes in and his attitude is still shitty, he flames the team publicly for weeks and now they're basically locked out of playoffs. DLift deserves far more blame than Impact for this split but isn't getting criticized enough for it.
I think he wants out of LoL in general, not just TL. Maybe he is hoping if he plays subpar he can just ride the bench for a couple splits and collect the $$$.
Did DL flame his teammates in an interview recently? I’ve seen a lot of comments mentioning it
Cain/Dodo out. Hire analyst and coach like YamatoCannon.

Start looking for top lane sub and make Impact either earn his slot. 

Change the way your team actually plays the game and start looking for more aggressive plays with an aggressive jungler, or tell him to learn to play more positional tanks and continue to play around bot. Your goal is only making playoffs next split just to get to worlds, nothing else matters. Goal isn't to win the split anymore it's to just survive til worlds while building an identity again.
Dignitas paying Huni 2.3 million - can't even make playoffs.... GG Dignitas!
If you halfass but still play better than 3/5 team mates you can say whatever the fuck you want mate
I think the problem is how your thinking about the game and getting upgrades for Impact.  He had been one of the most consistent players in the last 4 years. He is top tier.  Why replace that? Why not replace your ADC who has a shitty attitude and your Mid who will never super carry, also has a shitty attitude, and believes his name alone makes him deserving of a starting spot.  

TL would have stayed top tier with Xmithie.  He was your golden ticket with his early game shot calling.  Now that is gone and it shows talent is more than just controlling your character, yeah DL and Jensen is great mechanics wise but game knowledge they both suck.  Getting caught and ganked repeatedly when a bronze player would know they are about to be ganked.
You have to get rid of Broxah or Core to get Ssumday.
He was tanking minions lol
yeah i mean kalista is a short range champion, he cannot work withou a front line,  and TL definitely did not have a frontline.
Apparently sharing thoughts about gameplay is frowned upon.  Those guys are the same people who call a person, "toxic", in game for calling out a very questionable play.  Zero hostility in my original post, but basically gets flamed for a subject that I'm sure everyone can relate to.  I guess if the shoe fits though, they saw it as a personal attack.
I forgot about C9 Shaggy, such an amazing picture. I expect to see it posted often if C9 and TSM fight in the playoffs.
On C9 he was known for slumping a bit in the split and picking it up hard for playoffs, worlds, etc. but usually that slump was still like top 5 top laner, Not him just straight running it down like he is now
Tip playing against kled:
Most dmg comes in his q/w. 

His W is the 4 fast autos. It does a lot of dmg, but kled HAS to use W whenever it is up and he autoattacks, it’s not an ability he can choose to cast. That means he will HAVE to use W on minions to CS - this is when you can trade, when he uses W to last hit minions and his W is on cooldown. 

If he throws Q and it attaches, dash or walk away to get out of range. It’s telegraphed and comes out slow so there is dodge potential. Really shouldn’t get hit by his Q unless he has E up to gap close. Bait going for last hits on minions to get him to use Q and then dodge. 


When he is dismounted: don’t engage unless you’re positive his W is down. Again it’s most of his dmg and how he will remount quickly. Even if W is down and he is close to filling his passive bar, his Q gives 25 courage if all bullets hit so be careful when dismounted in general. 

Your best bet is going down 10-20 CS, not trading unless he uses W on wave, and pinging a lot when he’s not in lane as his roams are strong.
Lol does he say this too? I've been trying to spam this comment as much as I can for the past year and a half or so but it never gains enough attention and fans constantly flame coach after coach for drafts.
100T, TSM, and EG are in now yes? There's no way they can finish 7th or lower.  If they all lose, they get to 9-9. Can't fall below TL/GG/Dig
>two former world champions

 Yeah, 7 and 3 years ago respectively. Nobody cares. Crown is a world champ too

 >one of the best junglers in the world from the last couple years

 Lol
> at home seeing steve buy out ~~licorice~~ ssumday

0% chance licorice would leave C9 when theyre doing this well.
My mom just entered my room and asked me to stop watching this garbage thing. I told her that League of Legends was a respectable e-sport with millions of player around the world. She responded: "I know. I was talking about TL, they're trash."
The whole team was half ass the whole split, DL was the scape goat because he talks the most.
Omg, just drop out of Playoffs already.
Yeah, Impact’s always been a rock, I’m not sure what’s happening to him this split, he’s looking so shaky right now.
TL deserved this loss with all the shit talk and fuckery. Would be a complete shame if they make playoff.
Anyone with a slight idea of how jungle works would have said so, but all Reddit can judge is mechanics and Broxah is good mechanically
You don't need to crack the sads over this.

His story either didn't happen, or it was a fuck up.

I don't think it's controversial to say that.
I'm not even joking when i say the decision making in those fights from TL were on par with my clash team.
I get what you mean with the whole Kayle Jiizuke thing, but it’s actually a phenomenal pick into the Ornn. The blind Renekton was int, but the Kayle into Ornn was actually a really good pick in the draft.
>I can't understand the Renekton pick here tho

They had to give Impact a champ with 2 dashes so he can stop getting killed.

But he used those to feed instead <:

Impact practicing social distancing in dragon pit
Uh TL's odds of making playoffs is about 0.33% (repeating of course)
You're completely wrong.
TL, aka "Ten Losses", is a professional team in the LCS that is often ridiculed for its lack of proactivity in drafts and heavy use of imports. TL is specifically known for its do nothing and lose two-trick-pony in low LCS standings..
The job of a head coach isn't entirely to draft, they have more responsibilities whatever they may be behind the scenes (no point really going into this). 


Cain probably does have the power to say no, but it's possible that these picks are working for them in scrims. We don't have any knowledge on the team to actually make these claims. 



EG just picked Renekton in first round of the draft last game despite having Sett, Ornn, and Aatrox open. I think Renekton is somehow working in scrims and teams are picking it on stage but it doesn't work because it's not a great pick.
i don't think this man deserved this. but this is Reddit. 

meh I'm gonna keep eating my popcorn.
This is the type if disconnect where the player loads in, moves, then disconnects so you can’t even remake.
so are TSM/EG/100T locked into playoffs now?
BOOM! What up guys SolokilledRenektononly here with another video showing you how to get time off from practice and scrims and to avoid international travel.
Impact has been playing bad all split.. He was carrying some games last year but he isn't at that level anymore at all.
Did they? 

I thought there was a doomsday scenario left?
Him half assing the first 10 games still was better than impact and whoever the hell they got for jungler. His Senna sucked but the team overall had more problems than DL's motivation levels.
N/A means not applicable, as it has not EVER happened before.
I thought this at first but the other comment above is saying that there could possibly be a 3 way tie breaker between Dig/GG, IMT and TL at 8-10 which will have to be resolved so that is still saving TL right now
he wasnt even autoing anything he was actually just running in circles. it sounds like an exaggeration or a joke but that's what he was doing
Not the best timing
I'm segregationist against gamers. I hope you go to the gamer gulag when Hillary becomes president.
C9 hasn't really ever choked at worlds.
He already retired, he went to NA

Jankos is as much the best player in the world as I am. Jankos is not even the best jungler in the world, hell he's not even the best jungler in EU. He's probably not even the best jungler in G2!
My little brother in silver 2 is closer to Jankos than Jankos is to being the best player in the world.
What’s your resolution of your Mac? If it’s a 5k I don’t think league client can get huge, but there is an option under “general” to change screen resolution
No, if GG or DIG force a three way tiebreaker IMT-TL-DIG/GG would play a tiebreaker... TL still isn't out but their chances are very slim

Well, if they continue this for Summer, I blame staff. However, let's say Doublelift was both burned out and tilted by how team comms worked now and they chose to force it anyway because of what they saw last year from the best international teams, this super star studded roster was just designed to fail. They maybe could have figured out a roster change midsplit if Broxah came right away but then they got desparate and hoped the best individually talented roster could make it work. Shit is tough, but I can give staff a pass for this split. No more excuses.
This is why I die to Xerath all the time.
Way back when you could make playoffs, but still be in relegations actually. When there were only 8 teams, when you lost in quarters, you'd go into a match for 5/6th with the other team that missed playoffs, if you lose that, you are fighting in relegations. This happened to CLG twice. Both times going to a 5 game series against Azure Cats and Curse Academy.
When you're chasing greatness...

https://imgur.com/a/kUdUJU4
TL always seemed to win last year by being lane dominant and just waiting to smash late game. I was never impressed with their macro. This season there is a lot more action early game and I think its showing TLs inability to read the meta.
Pretty sure the year they went to relegations was 2014, which was a year where the bottom 2 playoff teams played in relegations after losing in round 1
I just hope that C9 makes it quick so we don't have to watch this dogshit team anymore this split.
Impact is playing with 4000 ms. Broxah doesn't gank bot and middle usually doesn't have much action.
are you in comms? are you 100% sure he is telling the players what to play or are these veteran stubborn players implying what they want?

Something tells me Impact, Core, DL and Jenson do not like being told what to do
Time to ban all supports
Sorry, OOTL but where did the Doublelift shotcalling meme come from.
EG was locked last week, lol
No, the issue I have with your proposition is that toxicity does not go away by raising the level cap. Honestly, I think it would increase. Imagine spending an obscene amount of time leveling up your account to 60 or 90, finally joining a ranked queue, and having people who just feed or flame your first couple of games. Someone who just spent all that time leveling up that account is going to experience a significantly larger effect on those moments. Ranked games will mean more because it took much longer to get there, but that also means much more is on the line every game. If people experience negativity in those high tense games, it will have a much higher negative impact.

Also, raising the level cap doesn't necessarily mean that people will learn every single champion inside and out. There are other ways to learn champions besides just mindlessly grinding out normal games to get to 60/90. People now watch streams, videos or read guides to understand champions. Why can't this learning be done alongside doing ranked? Why can't someone who is level 35 play ranked with the champions that they know, while maybe playing normal games with new champions to learn them? 

Raising the level cap does three things:

1. Increase the demand for bot accounts and incentivize players to buy them rather than deter them (like you said you wanted)
2. Increase the intensity of every single ranked game, meaning more people will be highly toxic or flame if they spent all that time leveling up just to lose because someone is feeding
3. Prevent new players from wanting to join the game once they understand how much time they would have to grind to make it to level 60/90
Coaching staff
personally i think Impact has been the best top laner in NA since he came in season 5, Core is still an amazing support, i doubt you could name 5 junglers that have been better than Broxah while he was at Fnatic and no matter what you think about DL, he is the best player NA has ever produced
Spring split doesn't matter
This locks TSM, FQ, EG, and 100T right? 

TL is in 7th with 7 wins and they all have at least 9 wins.
DL was the worst person on the team the first half of the split. he looked meh that game imo, he made a few big plays, but not much you can do when the enemy top jungle is fed and your top is afk or not there.
With a triple tie between DIG/GG, TL and IMT they can go to playoffs.
That'd still be the last time it happened dude lol

I said he's strong, that's not the point of the change. As I said the numbers can change.

Why max Q early though? 2 points is all you need early (and late, which is kind of the issue), maybe 3. You're generally spamming it in lane fights and you lose a lot by adding an extra 30 to the mana cost for no gain.
The job is already finished. Even if IMT tie TL in score, they automatically advance over TL because they won 2-0 over them. TL are 100% out
He doesn't watch NA games at all as far as i know. At times i always think to myself why i watch this dogshit region on weekends as well lol
And the worlds comes and they end up choking 5 out of 6 games.

Hope they don't though
It's still 975 BE
They probably meant winning the split, then not making it to playoffs in the next split consecutively.
*Proceeds to flame teammates in 2 interview*
TSM 2016 lost at MSI when doublelift had a pentakill on Ezreal too
They'd force a 3 way tie with GGS or DIG, in which case they may have a chance to fight for their playoffs spot. Still most likely out, especially after today, but mathematically not quite yet.
I was really confused but I think I get why: DIG and GGS aren’t eliminated from playoffs yet, so if there’s a 3 or more way tie, head to heads don’t matter.
Exactly, Doublelift has still otherworldly mechanics and was smurfing all game. The only blame he can get is complaining instead of consistently trying to carry these 4 shitters
If you say 10th is the bottom and 9th is 2nd from the bottom then 7th would be 4th from the bottom
I swear man in regions like NA or KR champs like renekton and rek’sai shouldn’t be worth picking when 90% of the time the game is still even and nothing gets accomplished on these champions before they fall off.

This isn’t just directly targeted at TL as this draft difference happened in C9’s one loss but it hurts to see teams make it harder for themselves.
You *THINK* it's too far, but as a certified S-tier internet janitor you're about to deal with a fuckload of hot garbage, good luck.
Technically, back in Season 3, you would still get sent to relegations if you lost in the first round of playoffs (i.e. finish 5th/6th).  So they played in relegations *and* made playoffs.
The option is called attack champions only so it makes your cursor red (or if using legacy it’ll glow) so repressing that key turns it off it’s useful for team fights when you may missclick a minion instead of a champion
I couldn't stop laughing when I saw that
can i have a link to that
Finn is so bad and he is only 17 years old. Imagine how bad he will be when he hits 20...
Not true, when the LCS had 8 teams, 6 went to playoffs and 3 got relegated. The two teams who lost in playoff quarter finalss played to see which would be relegated. In Summer 2014, CLG lost in QF then lost to Dig in the 5th/6th match. So they did play in both playoffs and relegation.
As a cloud9 fan. Please no.
It was indeed a game the Mutliplayer Online Battle Arena named league of legends..
Nice
No, if IMT goes 0-2, TL beats C9, DIG goes 2-0 or GG goes 2-0 they will force a 3-way tiebreaker, in that case h2h does not matter.
Looks like he's with Team Radiance.

https://lol.gamepedia.com/Radiance
Sub Tactical in for Doublelift.

I also hope there is a Breaking Point type of documentary on this TL split.
Not in Cloud 9, but he's a part of Radiance, which is Hai's org.
There would be other 8-10 teams, forcing multi-way tiebreakers
You joke, but every successful fight in this game came from DL playing aggressively and forcing a play.
I don't think you can even count KT Rolster since it was almost entirely a different roster.
Back then, the loser of the 1st round of Playoffs went straight to relegations. That was the CLG vs CRS Academy split
i don’t think he’s bad but he’s not great either. he’s just there. not throwing or feeding but not popping off making plays to win the game either
I believe if there is a three way tie, they play a tiebreaker. I think one of DIG and GG would have to tie Liquids record, which is kinda prerequisite in DIGs case because otherwise Liquid is out anyways. Dont quote me on that though.
You realize there are 9 teams in LCS that don't know how to draft? And even C9 have poor drafts every now and then. 


Do all these teams have internal issues then or what? 


Most of your claims (and a lot of this sub's regarding TL's issues) are based on conjecture and assumptions, which makes it kind of difficult to blindly shit on the coaches.
BAI BAI TL
And they somehow managed to lead in cs.

 If impact didn't play like my top laners in soloQ, they could stand a chance.
I guess TL had no problems staying at home
And did everything they were expected to until now. Doesn‘t seem bad in my book.
Lmao during the dragon fight, dude was legit just walking back and forth in the pit
Nope, different system back then - you could actually make playoffs, place last and get send into relegations.
I really hope he was having connection problems. I don't even know what to say.
Fucking Curse Academy.
Team Losers
Old Nidalee and Old Gragas... may as well throw in Old Sion as well
Its quite likely that every TL-player makes more than a million in salary each year and this is what they bring to the table. 
Let that sink in.
Broxah has been invisible, but holy shit is Impact fucking dogshit.
Impact taking social distancing to heart
https://twitter.com/G2GrabbZ/status/1244052715111624706
Took CoreJJ way too long to turn on his monitor and by then it was too late
Definitely. He bailed them out of a relegation once. This guy above is wrong.
Thanks man. Lots of people recommending Lux.
yyyy buddy if they would be 4th from the bottom they would be in playoffs
? What.
Not sure what you're talking about a regular ticket is 900 blue essence
Broken Blade was definitely the biggest problem this game.  He literally inted twice.
That's some recency bias. TSM also played Bo3s and we're hyped to be top 4 at worlds that's how dominant they were
They are out. IMT has the 2-0 over TL , even if IMT loses all games they still go through over TL
Xmithie is the best NA player ever.
Why is Impact running in circles in the dragon pit when WildTurtle is standing right next to him asking to get engaged on? He did literally nothing that fight, which could've been a huge win for TL.
>Last time Impact missed major region playoffs: LCK 2014 Summer on SKT T1

He didn't miss the playoffs, they lost to Samsung White.
TL have a lot to be grateful for despite this. there's always next split
I think the real surprise for me was that it took FlyQuest so much fucking effort to win this game. They're technically the 2nd place team, but it looked like two low tier teams duking it out.

NA feels so weak this split.
I think there's a difference between attacking a community and wanting to create another community with a certain demographic. This is not hateful or feminazi in any way.
Lmao, TL should waste all their money on coaches to force Jensen and Impact to play carrychampions. Literally getting payed millions and still cant play other champions that aren't renekton, aatrox, and mages.
Drake > Impact in having an impact that dragon fight tbh. Not too sure what he was waiting for in the dragon pit when the fight already broke out.
Impact
Relegation used to hit the last team in the playoffs IIRC
TL won one bo3 they weren't expected to. Over 2 years.
Well.... Not anymore I guess
Not his fault when TL gets outdrafted every game for an entire split? Interesting...
Wanna bet TL will win tomorrow against C9 since it doesn't matter anymore...
Couple of sketchy moments for sure.
Ohh shit. Forgot that DIG and GG could still get tiebreaker. There could even be a 4 way tie at 8-10 because GG and DIG's matches don't overlap.
I really wish we could know how Liquid's split would go with Xmithie. Their issues are so deep that I can't believe it's purely due to the jungle swap but maybe Xmithie is truly a goddamn genius and carried the team on his back. 

Impact is legit not LCS quality right now. Broxah is doing his best impression of a TSM jungler. DL doesn't look half bad these past games after the bench but not doing anything special either. CoreJJ has not been lane dominant at all which is completely uncharacteristic. Draft sucks as well but last split's Liquid could have gotten this same comp and steamrolled.
In case of 3 way tie you get a single elimination bracket and TL would just go to the bottom of that bracket.
I hope Steve is happy with his investments this season.

Meanwhile Jack over at C9 has to be dancing a constant jig of happiness.
he prorably didnt missclick but tried to attack someone slightly out of range causing his champ to walk around
How many times?
Kinda funny to see all of TL proactive plays were just Kalista ults, and even when corejj ulted the entire team everyone just ran with their tails between their legs when Doublelift was the only one going forward, trying to fight with the taric ult. Clearly they haven't fixed their communication issues at all.
Spring split doesn't matter so it's fine
3 years right? Bought Doublelift to play relegation didn't they? lmao
or ekko or ryze?
I nearly spit my drink when that ad came on
It's just a matter of time before all NA teams dreams get crushed again tbh
Since you are not the first person to recommend Lux I think I'll give her a shot. I have some weird aversion to her because of how annoying she is to play against but I'll have to get over myself haha. Thanks man.
I didnt notice it live, but during the replay watching him just watch the team chase his down and doing nothing. Insane how bad he has looked.
Nah, I'm sure they will manage to lose the tiebreakers, but I like stats and people are being dumb about it.
i think they will get hard smacked tomorrow anyway and i dont see dig going 2-0 either, they play tsm tomorrow and imt today.
Consider that bruisers and tanks are melee and need to get into melee range where they can get chain cc'd and die. Mages are ranged and can insta kill people at a safe distance
“Last time” as in most recent
 I haven;'t had time to watch lcs religiously in a couple of weeks , so i can't talk about how he has been played lately , but keep in mind that he is a plug in  player in the middle of the split , when his team already gave up.
Lmao literally you are fucking. 
If C9 didn’t play there comp well then it was a loss because of the little damage they had as I stated. Fuck off already dbag
wtf was impact doing this game?? that ring around the rosy he was doing in the dragon pit was ridiculous. 

What does broxah do? Legit not impressed with him at all.
Even then they'd be tied at 8-10, which immortals owns. TL is out

EDIT: Yeah a crazy tiebreak could get them in. I stand corrected. Also important to note that this game locks FLY EG 100T and TSM in.
TOP DIE
Either replace Impact with a different top laner

Replace the coaching staff

Or change in-game shotcalling back to what it used to be

One of those things I think number 3 is the easiest one
They actually didn't, they just got 5th/6th four of his six splits with the team.
No big meaning to spring split made him unmotivated, got benches, and the 2016 TSM scrim games made him nostalgic AF. He was literally gushing over his time on that squad. Then he exposes TL's issues on stream the week of their do or die weekend. YIKES. 

His mental is straight up boom
Feel bad for Cain

he is 100% being replaced before next split and its probably not even his fault
Are there now 5 teams locked in playoffs? They kept talking about fly being second to lock in but isnt the only spot up for grabs is 6th seed?
[foldy sheet with nice colors!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bexWdaFfLh8e_B_VXnUhwvDM1-xbLMccho8tqCicZcM/edit?usp=sharing)

After FLY vs TL:

FLY is the second team to officially be locked playoffs!

TSM is now definitely in at least tiebreakers.

TL has a chance for playoffs in only 10 of the 128 remaining scenarios. If they lose to C9 tomorrow, they are definitely out.

EDIT: oops, bad math again. C9, FLY, TSM, 100, and EG are all LOCKED playoffs now!
If TL is a cut throat as they like to talk themselves up to be then the coaching staff is getting the axe on top of potential team changes
Cain out

Me in

5head

And throw like a billion dollars at Blaber for him to leave C9 so they can pick up like Kiin or Rascal or something lol
wrong they are 0-2 vs immortals they are out
They were destined to only win Four splits
4th from the bottom is 7th. 10th, 9th, 8th, 7th <-4th from the bottom.

Edit: It's kinda weird to think about but yea. lol
Unless DIG or GG go 2-0, which gives them a 3-way tiebreaker with TL and IMT.
Seriously. He should’ve been more motivated. Maybe then Broxah and Impact wouldn’t lose so hard to Santorin + Solo.
impact never missed ogn.
Impact with the Sword cosplay lol
licorice isn't going anywhere from spring to summer. Solo maybe a bit more questionable but i wouldnt be suprised to find out that he's locked up in a contract till the end of this season.
Yeah dude deserves most of the blame that's heading his way. Sure Broxah couldn't get here on time but that's no excuse to get solokilled by Keith
I know he's played like shit this split but this game was on top jg supp, legit had no frontline.
Damn, TL is pretty much out at this point. Each individual event I feel is already unlikely and when you need all of it to be that way just to get tiebreaker, it’s looking really grim for TL right now.
10th, 9th, 8th, 7th.
players can't ride on their old legacy forever

No they always made it to at least quarters, just that most of the time they got knocked out at quarters as well
TL is not respecting quarantine. They are not supposed to go out and they just went out of spring split before playoffs lmao
And fully deserved. Impact should've been subbed out after the first few weeks. At least an academy top would int for cheaper on stage. Fucking disgraceful performance the whole split from Impact.
literally the only proactive play made this game was initiated by doublelift lmao. but lets not let him be the main shotcaller xDD
Best summary of this game is that fight at 2nd cloud drake when Impact was wiggling around in dragon pit hesitant to make a decision, poping ult and then finally just leaving dragon pit while rest of FLY went to hunt down his teamamtes.
If TL doesn't pick Rene 5th, they'd wins the draft hard. Give Impact GP and focus snowballing botlane with the Ult. But they pick Rene and play 4v5. So FLY didn't win draft, TL threw a good draft into the garbage can. Fits the commercial after the game. Lol.
>no it doesnt

In most scenarios it does. Adding another connection point from your home to the game server has more disadvantages than benefits. Not saying the benefits aren't there. I'm aware of routing  connections differently.


>how would companies like exitlag and wtfast have millions of yearly turnover?

Because people buy their services?
LS is that you?
I wouldn't really call mages "really strong", except in fringe cases like cassio and vlad, especially when compared to meta assassins and juggernauts. They have better carry potential than marksman, sure, but that's just the nature of ADC.
They need to beat c9. then they need a 3 way tie. So yeah they are pretty much out since they need to rely on GG and Dig winning.
Nah

10

9

8

7 <--- 4th
No, it still rolls based on 60/40 or 60/20/20
If dig or gg finish 8-10. It's 3way tie.
Mathematically not yet. But id bet my life on then missing.
Team liquid just don't seem to be awake. That level 1 gank by Santorin was unexpected but so many mistakes across the map.
Is Lemonnation still around?
no impact
It's the combination of players and their playstyle.

DL is a passive-until-he-gets-items player.

Jensen and Broxah haven't shown synergy together.

And Impact got cheesed this game.
TSM and fly taking TL outta playoffs
2 former world champions doesn't mean shit when Impact won it in 2013 and Core in 2017 (Core played decently this split tho). 


Broxah had a pretty meh year last year and the "best NA player ever" literally said he didn't care about this split multiple times throughout the year and was even benched for it.



Impact and DL inting (earlier in the split) isn't because of coaching
Unfortunately yes the afk games will count against you. It's just how league works. And even though you are placing in bronze, your MMR will be high since you were in gold before, which means you will have high lp gains for wins and low lp loss for losses. So climbing shouldn't be too hard
I'm aware of Impact inting on Renekton but he's been bad all split outside of Sett. I thought DL wasn't as bad throughout the split so I mentioned him first.
Three way tie is the only way I think


Dig need to win both games, imt lose both game and tl need to defeat c9
He said last time, not every time
And that's where all the anime girls get jealous...
Let the man shotcall and this never would have happend
That DL ad after a TL game always gets me rolling from laughter.
Why is Impact running in circles in the dragon pit when WildTurtle is standing right next to him asking to get engaged on? He did literally nothing that fight, which could've been a huge win for TL.
There's a 3-way tie possibility. Head 2 head doesn't matter in a 3 way tie.
Cain is still there during draft. If Impact says, "Let me try and outplay Solo as Renekton." then Cain should still have the power to say, "No."

If he doesn't then what is Cain even doing as a coach then?
IMT 0-2 with a DIG or GG 2-0 leaves 3 teams at 8-10 if TL beats C9.
10th, 9th, 8th, 7th
In other news, TL is 4th worst team.
Yeah they played in relegations at some point, so they def missed playoffs lol
I don't get it, how does TL make playoffs if IMT loses twice and they beat C9? Don't IMT own the head 2 head?
it's not just about win rates though, it's also about pick/ban rate.  when garen has a better pick rate mid than almost any mage that isn't an assassin, something might be wrong.
Oh look another whining adc, my favourite thing to laugh at on this sub
I don't know how you draft better when your top lane is getting last pick and hard inting 3 weeks in a row. Feels like it doesnt matter what you draft when one side of your team is down 2-3 levels at 15 minutes every game.
Can’t wait to watch the match of the weak
If there's a 3 way tiebreaker with Dig or GG they have a chance.
TL doesn't have a coach or these internal issues would be at least *SOMEWHAT* ironed out, it's probably a player run org considering the paychecks, performance (until recently), and star power. 

I wouldn't be surprised if the coach until this point just existed to give basic draft frameworks and let good veteran players do their thing. 

Unless you have the respect of the players reining in egos of e-athletes is a near impossible task.
Its obviously because of how absolutely incredible all the other NA teams are this split. 

lol I can't even type that with a straight face
at least he was motivated though
Neat. Consider the feeling mutual.
Tanks counter Assassins, nothing unusual here
And that way they just force a three/four way tie, where they have to win two more games. So, the chance is hyper slim.
no, they can get a 3-way tie with IMT and GG in which case TL and GG play one tie breaker and the winner plays IMT for the 6th spot.  There's also a 4-way tie scenario where IMT goes 0-2 and both GG and DIG go 2-0.  Both of these are incredibly unlikely and predicated on TL beating C9 anyway.
Get rid of Cain.
Cant want for the next spicy DL interview / stream talk flaming his team
TL should put Impact on a tank and Broxah on Karthus if they want top jg to be useful in the slightest.
My mom just entered my room and asked me to stop watching this garbage thing. I told her that League of Legends was a respectable e-sport with millions of players around the world. She responded: "I know. I was talking about TL, they're trash."
Looking for tier 3/4 jungler that voicechats

IGN: Acified
7th you mean...7,8,9,10.
Right. Thanks.
It’s not what you say...

It’s what you DO
.... no, it isn't. Count for yourself
r.i.p.
Rapid fire? Where's the drama in that?
You misinterpreted what they said. They need IMT to lose both games this week (go 0-2) and for TL to beat C9.
Seems like buying success only works for 2 years at a time
Solo and licorice. These two have the best laning phase
yea but i know for sure they've made specific changes to one for all for specific champions, so all I was saying is that it's quite possible they would do the same for singed. especially cause they said they're closely monitoring the game mode balance right now. 

im sure if they wanted to do it, it wouldn't be hard.
so, anyone waiting for breaking point part 2?
In a forum about discussion, your point is that /u/comeinnerknows talks too much and that's why they're bad?

And they're downvoted, you're upvoted?

Low quality sub.
Impact was playing with his SKT worlds skin as well
Break the bank for Ssumday
That's why there needs to be a 3 or 4-way tie
But IMT are 2-0 over TL so they auto win any tiebreakers.
Origen went from finalists to relegated between Spring 2016 and Summer 2016, though they were not champions in Spring
If GG or Dig go 2-0, TL win against C9 and IMT go 0-2 there will be a 3 way tie that will be resolved with tiebreaker matches.
My mom just entered my room and asked me to stop watching this garbage thing. I told her that League of Legends was a respectable e-sport with millions of player around the world. She responded: "I know. I was talking about TL, they're trash."

Doublelift: our communication is literal garbage right now

Reddit: stfu loser kid. motivation work improvement team
It was a good hour of daydreaming before all my hopes and dreams were crushed. 

At least I can go out to the bar and.... Goddammit.
His best
Legends say he’s still in that pit....
DIG can win 2-0 and force a 3 way tie.
10, 9, 8, 7. Do you even math?
Impact busy counting his paycheck money
There is one road in rn and their fate is 100%out of their hands
Licorice vs Impact.

lmao
Didn't clg collapse after they won a split?
He is currently the best player in the world.
I really don't think I've seen a game where Renekton has looked good. Why do teams keep picking it??
\>TL doesn't make worlds

\>DL retires with a 50 page Donezo Manifesto 2.0

\>TL signs Ssumday to a $XM contract, larger than Huni's DIG sign

\>TL becomes 4th place team again with Ssumday/Broxah/Jensen/Tactical/CoreJJ
How is it not? F2p games do this shit all the time bud
Noticed this on the Gun Goddess MF icons.
Fly quest is second in terms of consistency. Think about that. Think about how inconsistent they have been. Now think about how the third most consistent team is TSM. It really makes me wish relegation were back. Some of these teams really need to go.
I like how people still blame DL and the Kalista pick. You can't watch that game and believe he was the problem there. He deserves some of the blame for how the split went but people still blame him in games like these lol.
i addition to imt losing both games, either dig or gg has to end with 8:10, so then it can be a 3way tie where the h2h doesnt matter
He was the best last year.
they can still get in if Immortals looses both games and TL wins against C9
Probably. It'll come down to tiebreakers probably but they are 0-2 vs IMT and EG so they are in a real tough spot. Oh and they absolutely have to beat C9.
If only he was allowed to shotcall so he could tell Impact not to get solokilled
Kt rolster got gutted tho
Only soft inting to avoid a ban from Rito, truly a 5Head play.
You are proposing to double or triple the amount of time it would takes to hard level an account just to be able to play ranked (which I still don't see what benefits would that even bring).  If you compare that to a slight increase in price for a bot account, what is the extra 3-6 months it would take to take an account from lvl 30 to 60 compare to that cost?  What you are proposing has very little benefits and the side effects would grossly out scale whatever benefits you think it will have.  We want LESS bots in games, not MORE.
fucking doublelift getting impact killed non stop from his motivation issues, ffs double get ur head in the game.
He has himself to blame for having such a shitty attitude.
Impact is fucking awful.
Well, maybe if he had some MOTIVATION from the start they wouldn't need him shotcalling and a fucking miracle to get into playoffs 🤪
Not true. Immortals have 8 wins atm.
Wonder if they replace Impact for summer. Have a feeling that DL will end up leaving after this season* too (contract ends this year iirc?)
Do it we got like six more clones in the back.
Thank you for this guide. I started playing jungle recently and find myself not knowing what to do. This gives me direction where I had none.
Even if that happens IMT have the head to head. All of their outs relied on 100T not winning todays game.
Its actually minndblowing that Impact has played like shit the whole split and hasnt been benched a single time
You can't do much if you get trolled or inted in provisionals, it's a really shit system but thats how it is.

In my set of 10 I think at least 7 games I had braindead junglers and inters and didn't see someone on the opposing team run it down once, just sucks
So how topedo'd do you think this roster is gonna be next split? I bet doublelift gone at the very least. No way he doesn't jump at a way out.
Ik people say it's easy to blame the draft after u see the result but giving impact ur weakside player that wont get any attention Renekton is like ffing top lane and saying u are going to play 4v5 ...
HOLY SHIT LMFAO
Isn't Immortals 2-0 vs TL so it doesn't matter?
Pops ult and runs in circles in dragon pit LUL
TL Odoamne pending?
Pillar into syndra balls really screwed up what TL wanted to do.
the worst part about being a liquid fan is knowing that there isn't a clear upgrade for us to make to improve this team.

What NA top laner could replace impact?
Poor shotcalling by DL tbh
C9 and then Everyone else is NARAM.
DL has been poor all season, but how do you even mention him after that game. Impact hard inting on a last pick renekton.
IMT is 2-0 vs TL. Even if everything goes TL's way, they'll tie IMT at 8-10. IMT takes the tiebreaker and makes playoffs.

Edit: nvm 3 way tiebreaker or 4way tiebreaker might allow TL a way in. I guess it'll be clearer by the end of the day.
Tbh, OG C9 looked pretty similar.
I love the doublelift Alienware ad placement immediately after essentially being knocked out of playoffs XD
And DIG or GG go 2-0 to force the triple tie.
Mega cope.
I think if IMT go 0-2 and DIG or GG go 2-0 there can be a 3-way tie at 8-10, which TL  might get to play, but that's the only way for them to even get a tiebreaker.
Copy this fire to make Broxah retire.
Intpact has to go.
you don't get to half ass the first 10 games of the split then have the right to flame your team.
Could replace impact with an academy top and wouldn’t notice. 

Tbh him and kumo on back to back renenton games looked identical.
They're wrong.  Immortals is 2-0 vs TL.
My mom just entered my room and asked me to stop watching this garbage thing. I told her that League of Legends was a respectable e-sport with millions of player around the world. She responded: "I know. I was talking about TL, they're trash."
Am I missing something? What was with Impacts lack there of? That was really hard to watch.
that was during worlds 2017
Basically Steve can't afford to pay for another pandemic.
**When you're chasing greatness, just remember. It's not about what you say. Its about what you do** 

Thank you Alienware.
wow watching impact pop ult and literally do nothing during its duration during that last dragon fight was something else.
Can't wait for C9 to pull out all the tricks to crush TL in their tracks!
Nice wall of text, there's still absolutely no point in going for the shuffles, it's not even about risk vs reward, because there's no reward in doing it against 100t's comp, azir was having a hard time even dps-ing in the back because of viktor's spells / ornn naut r / aphelios flamethrower, I guess inting would have been better.

As I said, typical reddit analyst.
Nah, if he was shotcalling TL would have won  /s
F for Liquid
that'd be 6th, which is playoffs lol

edit: holy fucking shit i might be braindead
ROFFFLLLL
No, IMT has tiebreaker over TL, and is the only one they can catch. TL is RIP. EDIT: Or I guess some weird tie-breaker rules can put them in if GGS wins? That's so weird that GGS tying TL and IMT can possibly get TL in? But GGS sorta blows and still has to play FQ and TL has C9.
It would've looked a lot better for DL if Impact was able to zone off Syndra and Xayah. Df?
Oh my god that ad after the loss that's crazy.
THAT HONDA COMMERCIAL PLAYED RIGHT AFTER THEY LOST I CANT
When you’re chasing greatness...
Impact gone, all new coaching staff, hire an analyst
Oh my god the ad featuring Doublelift right after the game was too funny.

 "It's not what you say, it's what you do"

Cya TL
at home seeing steve buy out licorice
After their game, Team Liquid visited an orphanage in Taipei. "It's heartbreaking to see their sad little faces with no hope", said Charlie, age 6.
Getting ready to take a break since spring split doesn't matter.
Bench DL and put in Tatical for ultimate chaos
I was alive to see Team Liquid, a team that won 4 consecutive championships, miss playoffs. The Dankest Timeline
I was at home watching LCS
Hi I would be interested added u in league and discord
What a flank by power of evil in the end. Subtly won flyquest the teamfight.
They're 0-2 vs IMT so their only chance is a 3 way tiebreaker with GGs winning 2, them beating C9, and IMT losing 2 first

edit GGs or DIG
IMT is 2-0 against TL. There's no way TL can make playoffs.

Edit: 3 way ties, right.
Another PERFECTLY timed Doublelift commerical *chef's kiss*
"It's not about what you say, it's about what you do". Riot's comedic timing with the commercials is absolutely savage.
Q the doublelift / Honda taking out the trash commercial.
[TL fans: spring doesn't matter guys it's okay...](https://i.imgur.com/dTcAHZc.jpg)
I believe so.
They have to beat c9 and hope immortals lose both of their games and then win a tie breaker. So basically ya, they are out.
DL throwing his playoff chances in the trash after every loss is too funny.
https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqrjry/lcs_2020_spring_week_9_day_1_live_discussion/flsc4au/
Cause it also requires Dig or GG to go 2-0 lol
Breaking Point 2: Electric Boogaloo
TL need to make change next split
DL throwing Impact away in that Honda commercial. Cold blooded.
Wildturtle preventing DL from making playoffs. I'll take "things I would've thought was crazy talk a year ago" for 200, Alex.
Holy fuck that Doublelift TL ad always gets me lmao
And the DL ad to put the cherry on the top ! Perfect !
Big oof
They need to stop playing this doublelift commercial after every game.  Its the most ironic thing to hear doublelift talking about “its what you do not what you say”
I never thought I would want this IMT roster to win so badly.
B-b-b-but Rito wants their season 10 champs to be useful... (COUGH SENNA  COUGH)
You probably thought 2020 couldn't get worse, but then you watched Impact playing this game.
feels fucking bad for dl and core.
Impact just sprinting it the whole game
Players have a voice in draft. Not everything goes down to the coach, not sure when people will understand that and not blindly blame coach any time there's a poor draft.


(There are some teams that have the structure where coach has a lot of say, like C9 with Reapered, but not many have that)
Wt is good but not as much as you think he is.
Ahh the refreshing kZlyN61 link. I will never forget that beautiful head nod.
Oh how I love it. What a wonderful split this has been. Feels bad for broxah tho
Impact enjoying that retirement money
damn, imagine the dmg if it could stack tho...
dl taking out himself in that ad I see
They need to beat C9 tomorrow and have IMT go 0-2 and have either GG or DIG go 2-0 to force a 3 way tie for 6th.
Its just perfect
Well that’s practically impossible
Pretty sure clg with double missed playoffs at least once.
How the tables have turned
doesnt IMT have the 2-0 over TL though? so they are auto above them?
Uhh isn’t TL out? At best they are 8-10, and at worst IMT is 8-10....but IMT has the 2-0 tiebreaker....
They actually played the doublelift commercial after tl just boosted from playoffs, lol
This along with not using a stopwatch in last fight in mid lane (broxah) oof
When you're chasing greatness: it's not about what you say, it's about what you do.
I liked the part where he ulted and made circles in the dragon pit.
A missing link? :D
TL is 100% out now even if IMT go 0-2, right? IMT still have the 2-0 head to head over TL.
The time when everyone played what they wanted to play. 

No „you cant pick that, thats useless“ 

No „i must counterpick my enemy because i only want to win“ 

Nobody plays for fun anymore. Not in normals, not in Funmodes.
Only exception is aram (most of the time)
Less than 1%
I had a problem where the cursor was red and I couldn't auto attack but was able to buy etc so I pressed that button and it went back to normal try it out might work for you
Wonder what the excuse is this time. Feel for Broxah, guy has been royally shafted this split.
If I'm Doublelift I'd want to punch impact so hard in the face right now. Pick a dogshit champ and just run it down the whole game. Impact completely griefed the entire rest of the team this game and this split.
Absolutely not lol. EG at least got smashed by C9 of all teams so if they win convincingly tomorrow they could be decent. But TSM and FLY are both either solid or hilariously bad.
THE ADD AFTER THE GAME LMAO
"Goooood bye T - L! Clap! Clap! Clap, clap, clap!"
Besides getting to MSI finals. Nobody expected them to do more than that - I would say that even getting to MSI Finals should be considered overperforming.
ngl that honda ad kinda fits
Why does immortals losing help? Doesn’t imt have the 2-0 over them
Man I absolutely adore these advertisement timings!
splish splash tl is still trash
DL without motivation > INTpact
Impact was 1v1ing the invisible drake give him a break
they need imt to go 0-2 this week and they need to beat c9

said it on stream a few mins ago
My mom just entered my room and asked me to stop watching this garbage thing. I told her that League of Legends was a respectable e-sport with millions of player around the world. She responded: "I know. I was talking about TL, they're trash."
Nah they can get in if they beat C9, and if IMT lose today and tomorrow
If TL somehow win out, I will eat a bag of dicks.

In 6 weeks since Amazon isn't shipping non-essential items fast anymore.
Wait until steve buys licorice or ssumday
~~Everyone locked in playoffs. Immortals is 2-0 vs TL, meaning even if TL wins tomorrow, they can't pass Immortals in the standings.~~

Yes you're correct. There could be 3-way or 4-way tiebreaker at 8-10 and IMT could still be out.
Lmaoooo the DL ad right after that loss
TL should never draft reksai or renekton, those champs involve actually doing something early game


oh game, as a fan, they didn't deserve to be in playoffs and the fact they voted to cancel spring split because "it doesn't matter" just goes to show they physically and mentally did not deserve to go to playoffs, they checked out before the split started
True, and Kennen can still be a menace in teamfights, especially if you had to let him farm for 20 minutes. But champs like Kalista and Lucian are easy to itemize against and fall of hard. Just one cc spell in a teamfight and they should be dead.
I played Sett VS Taric.
Their stand proved to be superior tho...

Vayne is the only champ of those that you cant easily itemize against. Vs all of the others you just play it safe, get a defensive item and then proceed to run them over.
During set 1 I once lost LP for being 4th place. I contacted Riot Support and they basically told me with specific enough MMR you can lose LP at 4th or gain LP at 5th.

Well, Cosmic Lux's lore is that she has always had a "shard of darkness" in her soul. So I guess that's symbolised by a black hole that seems to be restrained by a blue aura. Interestingly, it looks exactly like Dark Star Mordekaiser's Sapphire chroma... and that chroma isn't supposed to be canon. Unless...

Fact
It's how it looked when he was picked at LCS in 2018. He could throw himself into stupid situations and just walk away as if nothing happened.
Top minding their own business 😂
5th place gives +1 LP? I'd maybe understand 0 LP or -1 LP, but gaining LP at 5th place seems wrong.
Yup, that's right, it was killer vs other ap carries

So there was a post criticizing the devs. A dev responded back saying “haha your criticism doesn’t matter, our dev team has over 200 years combined experience!”


The original meme is saying “yeah lol with 200 devs” like they’re completely filled with rookies (this averages out to 1 year of experience per dev, which isn’t good for any company at any job unless it’s minimum wage, you want a more experienced workforce)  


The person you replied to is again memeing and saying “haha actually they have an average of 1/10th of a year experience each!”

trolling is always meta
Skt doesn’t count because it’s a skin gifted to the pro team as a sort of trophy and isn’t considered when seeing how many skins somebody has

Nice you’re just like me got a little bit of everything up there
Ok which Darius fed the enemy Darius ?
Its rly funny how bot lane is always so pushed up and constantly gets gankes, yet u get flamed as the jngler
I'm listening..
Rotating is moving to help a lane or help someone somewhere in the jungle. If you're pushed to tower and there's a fight between your jungler and the enemy jungler, you're probably free to go help them.
Trade could mean swapping lanes so mid goes top and top takes mid for a more favorable matchup or could also mean trading kills so you dive idk lux for a kill and die to tower meaning she kills you as well.
nice

I feel really bad when I kill the enemy jungler for top scuttle and nobody on their team rotates putting them behind for pretty much every time we see each other at objectives or in ganks by 400 gold then succeeding ganks while their teammates continuously over extend putting them even further behind. Two kills early in the jungle means you have priority on scuttles, rift, and drags and I just know nobody on their team knows that and are gonna start screaming 'jg diff'

Back in my days, your first game would be with 2 lvl 30 friends on the twisted treeline.

You'd enter into the game and see the new champ, yorick, announced by the price of 6300 tiny swords. "Who the fuck is yorick?" you may ask, well, yorick was yorick before the rework, but that's a story for another day.

You'd go into the lobby and be like "What do I play, guys?" And they'd be like "Pick the yellow robot" "M'kay, Ghost and heal?" "Yeah, seems fine"

Load the game at 15 fps and you wouldn't be able to see your cursor, so you'd spend all game trying to aim a blitz's q with no notion of where are you walking whatsoever.

The highlight of the game? That piece of dopamine which got you hooked for eight years? Aiming a q with no cursor, in order for you, 2 games later, finding that the fancy option you chose for your mouse is making the game laggy as hell and with no cursor.
Dude I just won a singular game and got 300 lp. Tft ranked is wild
Yes..
You see, Ekko is a black character, and in real life, black people are minorities (at least in the United States). This is funny because Ekko is labeled as a "majority" in the picture. The title shows pride in the label because it evidences growth on a social level in such a way that black people are regarded as a majority. This enhances the comedy because it is simply a videogame, not real life.

He has good 1v1 against weak junglers. You don't struggle for the 1v1 with an early game jungler. You can also 2v1 him, he normally has no chance but that requires a bit of map awareness :)
Yes he has a good 1v1 but not against early game champions. You can pick whatever early game champion and still win the 1v1, then invade him and set him even more behind. Another counter to him is making his lanes lose. I had many games where I couldn't do shit because my laners wanted to int as much as possible

In the previous tweet he mentions "20+ professionals" so I'm guessing each has an average of 10 years of experience. Of course the context of the tweets in question is what makes this a laughable statement.

Ye, the odds of not playing against a team thats full of 5 assassins is slim to none. I’m glad u can find fun enemies and teamates

How many boxes do you see here? Its 5. Stop doing mental gymnastics to make the joke work. He has 5 skins not 4. Doesnt matter if it counts or not there are 5 skins
As if we aren't jokes ourselves already

The bois hungry
Thresh’s hidden passive was removed. It used to be that he would start with a soul if Lucian was on the other team
What the heck does it mean it doesn't count.
Doesn't count for what?

Also I see 6 so Im really not getting whats going on. https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Jhin/Skins
The “Defeat” at the end made me laugh into my coffee
You must be kidding me...
Are you in NA and was it the 1st day of OFA? If so i might've been on the Yuumi team but we grabbed a handful of kills before we got stomped lol.
Cuz diamond people in tft are luckier
Of course it's luck sometimes. The items, the champions and the comps other people are playing. But it isn't JUST luck yk? There's a reason why I'm silver and somebody else in diamond
Yeah it got buffed, it uses to be based like 0.7x of the enemy AP.
"Clean up in river, thanks!"
It's actually lucky in some way. I mean the shop follows what people buy and dont buy from it and that translates to the pick pool. So what everyone's strategy is can depends what other's strategy can be in some percentage of the situation
I was killed by yummi when I was playing adc
HASAKI
I've also seen a couple fiddlesticks run out from bushes scared.the shit out of me
Poppy is one of bests champs but champs she counter or Billy is off meta picks
True
I saw the best summoner name the other day. 4 shots of Jhin
That... is why I main him
Definitely, banana Soraka maybe cheap as hell but god dam its good skin.
The I haven't decided.

In case it pops for free for you in the future, so it can be undecided for as long you like.
the feeling a bronze call other bronze while everyone in that match is bronze
Totally get that I would put can't because money tight but I thought Prehaps they might get at a later date.
Still does 1k true damage with point and click R
So that's why my sweet Poppy counter's his jump.
Yes.
The new urgot skin that the whole community wanted
Yes
Yes
wait...can they all attach to the same person?
True, but seeing how hard they got stomped, I think there were more problems than not building GW.
No, This Is Patrick!
Sure but ignite aint always up like thornmail morello or executioners and warwivk can use all of them.. i was only talking about items.
I need me some Dark Cosmic chromas. A black one would be dope.
Mundo
All the Yuumi's and 3 Warwicks had ignite
This happened to me yesterday. It was 4th place that gave 1lp.

Good luck
Nice game, I did a game of yuumi yesterday and basically only me knew how to play yuumi, and I went ad crit, life steal. I went mid, we were against a bunch of pykes, and one of our members left cause they didn’t wanna play yuumi. Well he came back a few times to feed the pykes. But anyway I was destroying the pykes alone, even before I got yuumi on me, and held base with just our nexus for like 20 mins, Ended at like 23/4 deaths something like that
definitely not in EUNE
Actually kind of my goal. I'm going to apply for their data science internship next year. Really hope I get it.
I'm just too broke for it
Literally 2 posts above is a 15 hour old "daniel - the cooler daniel" meme

?XD
Tell that to my girl Kalista. She is left to the dust and because of this fucking God Ning she will got a nerf every high elo start playing her...
When you realize you can't upvote this anymore cuz its already at 4k up votes.
You can't make screenshot?
Congrats on the win!!!
Yes. Its a completely different game over there. EUW also isnt "better" than NA. Our playstyle just works pretty well against NA.
Bramble Vest/Thornmail, Morellonomicon, and Executioner’s Calling/Mortal Reminder.
Mundo
Flexing that 13% win rate
As said by Riot. Doesn’t count.
Why are all rakan skins so ugly
Tf happened to this sub.
Platinum is like bronze lv2 xd
When I get the enemy adc and support down to 200 hp as Ashe at level 1 and my support senna flashes under turret and gives them first blood I have a really hard time believing that they are better than me.
OTP
Removed  because wrong sub
It counts. If you count the amount of skins Jhin has there is literally 5 of them. Joke was funny when Project got released but now its just stupid.
Got her level 7
Just use support item bruh
Senna be like

This is tft for those confused, my dude probably got like 5th place but didnt lose lp for elo reasons
I main both adc & supp soo it wasn't big problem for me
Or 8 skins with 5 chroma each (subtract the cromas that are already in the game if there are any, never played jhin)
I wonder why Yasuo's shield is more powerful than any other but Tryndamere support carried me
Please use snipping tool or print screen... its not hard and it makes the photo look so much better. My eyes shall thank you 👀😍
I never actually played against bots
N-worders should be ganged after dashing abilities are on cooldown
I only see the thornmail
wait what memes
r/okbuddyleaguetard
I would if I played him. I generally prefer the joke skins verses the serious ones.
first & only
Didn’t notice that. Nice catch
dude same
To anyone asking, we’ve actually played Rammus
Simp
HELLO WORLD, I AM SINGLE!
Glad you enjoyed it :)
Indeed
I am laughing XD
Also good if you play against him
In my humble opinion Korean work in Korea cause they have different style of play and use rune that we don't...
As a Xayah main I am dripping right now.

I dont exactly understand. Is this this forever alone virgin joke?
They should make a Riot or Commando or something Azir skin, that'd be sick. Or maybe a tribal skin, that'd probably work better.

It is a game, and it is for fun, but it's *not* fun to get facerolled for twenty-five minutes because your 0/9 top lane Yuumi wanted to "have some fun lol calm down", while not surrendering. The only scenario this could be fun is if you're queuing with the person, and you're laughing about how hilariously you're losing, but for me at least, that requires a specific mindset to really get into.
I wish I could argue with it... But I just can't...
But you know nice gals finish last
Enemy bot: better bot wins gg ez
we gotta start a thread
play with me I don't have corona
I dont understand but ok
If you think about it it just means they have 20 people employed under “game design” since they’ve been around for 10 years

It doesn’t even need to be the same person
damn man you live like this?
Question, did you play as Zoe?
So hard this gonna be so ugly

There are multiple items with grievous wounds
Didja ever just think... the enemies better? It doesnt take very much to sway a match early on into a snowball.
Monstrous size has no intrinsic merit, unless inordinate exsanguination be considered a virtue.
I don't have money for it
They turned out to be right about wukong after reworking the  rework of the first rework after being wrong about wukong
Save bait should be appreciated more
The one with the skin is mostly the guy maining that champ so he always knows what to build and what to do
VS event with him and Zed seems like it can happen but there are a lot of better options.Plus they were bros and still kinda are so it would be weird.
A quiet place
I agree with everything you just said, accept the first part. Dark Star Lux wants to be the rightful master of the Dark Star and establish a Dark Court of Corruptants, of which she would rule as Queen.  As for Dark Stars as a whole, they want to destroy the universe entirely and then jump into the Dark Star, “leaving nothing but eternal oblivion”. All of this information comes from [this page](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Event_Horizon/Dark_Star)
Skt doesn't count but god damn there are like 20 other comments saying the exact same thing as you, look through like 3 comments to see if someone has already commented what you were going to say beforehand
What movie/show is this
I completely agree and it sucks that he can go 9/50 get an infinity edge the. It’s gg to everyone that’s not a tank
That sounds good
Tempted but didn't decided yet. I used to main Urgot and i liked the skin, but with the current situation of corona and all + being unemployed because of that make my situation kinda... Hard to decide. 

I have enough for a legendary, but no idea when it would be possible to get more
Zoomers dont remember when we could immediately play pvp at level 1 :D
*2 Cs lead.
Wait a second is that a JoJo reference?!
Totally agree but I feel every one is entitled to have a vote.

Like the 3 options are blunt because they are people like me who will be getting the skin.

Then their is people who like the idea who may or not get it.

Then there are people who think it's dumb.

Personally I wanted this skin because the idea and concept is funny but if they had down a darker version like dark guardian it would of been badass.

Like they could easily do this as a joke star guardian skin where he is good, but then do a dark monstrous dark guardian for him being cannon.

Like they could of made it a dark twisted nightmare.

Like I say the idea still exists. I know some people want dark star urgot but dark guardian would be more twisted.

Could have moons instead of stars.

Like I say this skin works as a fantastic joke but if riot where add him to star guardian universe I would hope they take him down a darker path.
I propose going multiples of 4
40 min xd
How long did this suffering go?
I am pretty it's Yuumi's puss
JG diff may mean the enemy is worse too
Even without playing Urgot, it's a nice addiction to my collection and it's not a bad joke
Who’s gonna ban Aphelios then :(
Ur got that
Not fair. You have 10 vs 5
Wut if they make 4⁴
r/foundtheambitionpleb
Tbh Idk, sorry. I'll give it a quick google though
Edit: it is in fact considered an unlucky number, because the word for it is spelled the exact as the way you spell death, just that the i (pinyin: sì for 4) has a different accent (pinyin: sǐ for death). This is Chinese btw
Out of lore, but isn't 4 also number of death in asian culture?
#+150% AP
So he is helping?
They spawn in the red buff bush, yesterday my friends were going to leash and nearly shit their pants
"Irelia is strong rn"
Thanks!
Wha-
If it's not a ranked game hop off the Yuumi's dick. It's a game, have fun.
Royal Rumble
/r/screenshotsarehard
On his IV-head.
Yeah, honestly I love him as a champ but that's a pretty shitty aspect. It doesn't feel good to be beating him all game and then he suddenly becomes a terror, and it doesn't feel good to be useless for most of the game then somehow become great despite hard inting from the start. I'd love for his Berzerkers Grieves powerspike to be a little stronger and then scale slower after that, maybe remove the crit interaction with his ult and passive, more damage on the ult and a temporary reduction on the per-unit dash cooldown instead of the 50% bonus armor penetration aftereffect. I don't know, I'm not a game designer but I love his dashy minion surfing playstyle and his ult and tornado are really cool.
But when you lose it's -30
Weird how there is almost no kills at drake and zero kills at baron.
/r/screenshotsarehard
They turned out to be right about wukong after redoing the remake after being wrong about wukong
Maybe he's just Jarvan.
Imagine having more than 3 skins, this post was made by velkoz gang
I played 5 yuumis against 5 Morgan's and we got totally destroyed
Haha funny sex number clap clap

I know this guy, Brock Turner the rapist! Who got 6 months for raping girls while they were passed out drunk.
so you delete SKT1, it's ugly anyways
If you want even more crit, play Yasuo
We did that and started winning every teamfight but then we got fucking split pushed to death, was super lame.
That 1 Gold fed you
Ohh, ok. Wait... do people seriously go to baron even in that situation? Ouch. Meanwhile in my case, its as if I were the only one who cares about getting baron or dragon when the game's even. Then the enemy team takes them and we get smashed.
It wasn’t said in all chat, I stay away from that unless its one for all, or urf
Blursed reply.
There are 5 actually
But lets be honest a smart Zed can bypass that and wait the seconds and attack you with the other attacks
Then, Rito create 40 more skins so Jhim has 44 skins
We aswell :p
But against shaco
I did this directly after winning my B1 promos, Back to B2 I go...
When he said she is charming now it will be literally
Lux receiving a skin hiatus
Honor Yorick
you either die a hero or you live long enough to become the villain
Ok thx
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvDIiWnJ-gk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvDIiWnJ-gk)
Its literally just because his gun has 4 bullets. He switched from knives to a magic gun and having to be proficient with 4 shots only made him obsessive about it
Which one is the anti-healing item?
they turned out to be right about wukong tho
Repost
It's time to be done
But he doesn’t have a single chroma on any skin yet
I feel like cosmic lux fits the character better, but Dark Lux just looks better aesthetically.
There are 5 they should delete skt one, its the worse of the bunch
Precisely
4 letters in name
Rakan, doing his job
you mean 44
how the tables have turned
Ironic since they are the hookers
Do you have a clip or a screenshot?
I was kinda meaning when the nexus is open and their whole team is wiped they still rush to Baron since it is up. I get what you mean though
Yeah, before she was released, there was a mist around the base
Big brain: you can't lose if you don't play
Mista doesn't like this element.
Nahh in every game today one of my botlane was afk sometimes even both
There still can be 44
THE PERFECTION MUST BE PROTECTED
Gold Experience Requiem: No.
Fair enough. I know I’ll get where I should be
You’re not factoring In that everyone doesn’t get the same LP for a win. You gotta “sweat” against silvers but you’ll gain more
top text



wholesome 100
Easy fix... make 44 skins
what is the pic from? lmao
Mid: top diff gg
And ashe wishes you a painful death after you ban her
I'm surprised they didn't surrender with it being 78-5 lol
Top: jg diff gg
Like Senna?
And yeah it shouldn’t consider hidden mmr. I’ll get to the ranked mmr I should be at naturally through ranked, why should I have to sweat at my high silver/low gold mmr to get out of bronze?
This is both teams! Mine on the left theirs on the right.
This happened to me I have proof as well we made sit-up training everyone in kid other than that last chap that chose to W the enemies... he got flames the whole game
Like fucking what happened to equal opportunity? What happened to no summoner left behind? Let me climb

It's all Ezreal's fault because he is Silver 3 and he dragged up the rank latter
my team is 3 bronze 1's a bronze 3 and a silver 3. their team? a silver four, two silver 3's, a silver 2 and a gold 3. good fuckin job rito. Did they miss big brain time and shit the pants? fuk u rito
nah xd I got an S+
You probably still only got an A+
Or the cancer teams like Malphite, Mordekaiser, etc
Only works when you hear the creaking sound of his lantern. At least that how it works for me.
I learned a few things today from reading the comments. Thanks guys.
No one cared who I was until I put the mask
It does on the first login. But when I switch accounts it gets stays on this screen until you hit the PLAY button.
He is an obsessive maniac who laments over every detail in order to make "perfect" crimes. Everything he does is in sets of 4, and also his guns has 4 shots with the 4th shot being a megacrit.

I still can't count past four!
Well, Six counting his base skin. But not counting that he has five skins
Wasn't it six or I can't count past four?
i didnt even know that was a thing on his r jesus
or maybe the adc sucks because the support sucks 🤔
I dont think yasuo, played him yesterday for my first time 11/3 30 k damage, the other yasuo mains inted and did no damage
That's the funniest shit ever, I did that yesterday as well
I do t know a whole much about the lore, what is it with Jhin and 4s? I read the Zed comic and it didn’t really say why.
Have fun in League? Dont think we’re playing the same game.
Yasuo, Katarina, Gangplank, Riven, Vayne, and any other champion with a high skill floor. Most lose, but the one that pops off becomes impossible to deal with. So he can spam his mastery emote as he 1v9
When you realize the man's forehead veins make the roman numeral for four...
Im planning to make a video of it... But I don't know If I will actually do it or how long it will take but If I do I will leave the link replying your comment
Made in heaven Has already reset za hando
When my 5 stack did yasuo vs yuumi, we all build executioners first item. The yuumis didnt get a single kill...
This reminds me of one good laugh that i had

I picked pre rework urgot as an adc (he wasnt that strong in the meta at the time) when i was playing with my friends. 2 of them questioned me, but the others assured i knew what i was doing

Start of the match, bugsplat. Ok, missed some time at the stsrt but got back to the game, just to be recieved by the enemy adc with these kind words:

"Lol, not only you're playing urgot adc but you're also late to the game. Get ready to be stomped"

After that they just engaged hard on me whenever they could, but when they tried to tower dive me with their jungler, i got a triple kill

At the end i carried the game with the mid laner and just enjoyed the salt that came from their adc

"You only won because you champ is OP, you have no idea how to play", etc.

I miss old urgot sometimes
We literally did this yesterday, did you play MF?
[1:08](https://youtu.be/xaaJbFxpfyE)
I got mastery 4 with Jhin and I'm afraid to play more and lose it :(

Now that’s what I call cultured (not scarcasm)
The one with the best skin
They need to release 40 skins at once. It's the only way
I knew i was hearing fiddle's efigies at the start of some games!
ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA
I want to see the replay of this game!
whats with the headline?

epic
Big brain time
Only 1 has heal reduction and on the wrong item
id rather just ban her
I’ve had this weird bug where I can see shadows of champions in the fog at the edges of range indicators (like attack move). I saw myself as Twitch sneaking around, but once I saw what I swear was a shadow of Fiddlesticks, scythe and all
Gotta keep that 10 Cs lead sorry
You mean 4 + 4/4
No, 4440, Riot has said, that Winning Team's skins does not count
Gbay99 moment
There are 5 actually
「ZA HANDO」erase these comments from existence!
I know the feel, just got elementalist a week ago too 😭
@loltyler1
Nowadays everyone in that level is a smurf kekw
That meme is the definition of bad champ desighn
What the fuck? I refuse to believe that, for your sake.
And here i am with a teammate wishing me one way ticket to auschwitz
Skt doesn’t count as a skin
Sky doesn’t count because it’s a skin gifted to the pro team as a sort of trophy and isn’t considered when seeing how many skins somebody has
One doesn’t count due to it being a skin from the live events
Skins depicting the winning team of live events don’t count as said by rioters
Source?
Nice
Haha Xd, now we need to wait for 420
If a riot employer publically and aggressively flame you, you get unbanned
Yeah they were trying really hard even ulting to the nexus but they lacked teamplay on that...
real chads pick duty and cosmic lux
I like how veins on his forehead look like IV so 4  in roman numerals
they were splitpushing all lanes because they couldn't kill us and I was the adc who had to protect all 3 lanes so yeah thats why I had a lot of cs
I'd say it sucks because one person picks his mains and the other ones play him for the first time
If that means i can get my 2 billion accounts unbanned sure
They just had to splitpush, it wasn't that hard,I don't even know how they lost, you don't need skill to take towers and objectives
This is why this mode is my favorite tbh xd
wait what
Thats why this game mode sucks
ok
That is definitely not true, they are the same color but one is pretty and one is Woody.
Alright, from now on pronunciation is Dema-cha, then.
I mean 5 is just 4 + 1
yeah because I was the pilot of 4 tuumi and they splitpushed a lot xd
wtf 483 cs with yuumi
Succ
That settles it. Cats are better than dogs.

Yes see but most of zeds damage is gone after Zhonyas is used
Death powerspike is true
Yes
Sorting by new

There’s space for only one Dark Cosmic around here, the lord of FOUR!
They share a "realm" or "dimension" but have their own arena boundaries. But yes, you could have a 5v5 in the Shadow Realm...
This is the old loading screen wtf

Wait, what if Jhin's true identity is Mista after Mista went insane, and league is just one huge Jojo reference?

I remember World of tanks before global chat was banned, you had 30 people insulting eachother permanently it was glorious
Be yourself, because the people who care don’t matter and the people who matter don’t care
A little something for everyone. I mean we can't do much to help or stop them.
Idk if you're being sarcastic or not
seems like the old UI
We probably going to try that later xd
You just made me think how ambition is actually stupid she can only destroy and she doesn't think about the consequences even if she wins she only knows how to destroy and in the end she would probably destroy everything and would be left alone in the darknes without anyone or anything and what would it give her absolute nothing. And also to create you need to be smart nobody is saying that pretty smart buy at least you need to think and why you need to inspect inspections ? Because everything have flaws and anything that is created needs some thoughts but sometimes things end up being bad but that's just how world works and on the other hand some things are just impossible with modern technology like Da Vinci's inventions were mostly impossible to create in his times but today most of them can be created with help of modern inventions. You say that ambition would win but you shouldn't ask yourself who would win but rather if somebody will win because world needs balance and one probably cannot exist without the other because without creation ther is no destruction and without destruction there is no space for creation
they did split push and almost won like that but we had a lot of speed
Peasants didn’t spilt push and have 2 go jungle!?

Yuumi vs Kench. We decided to stack all the Yuumis on top of each other and have all the Kench players eat each other. Everyone was inside a single kench and I don't think anyone deserves that much power.

You need to understand, Riot reeeaaally needed that extra 50 bucks from eternals.
The client just doesnt print money, as easy as that.
Whenever a Lux Main is flexing, a child in Africa drowns for maximum irony.
Its been a while since One For All was there so Im happy.
Im fucking sick of URF and ARURF tho.
You could play fun shit like AP Irelia, AP Gangplank or Full Movespeed Warwick but you wouldnt just loose, you would get dumpstered and wont have any fun.
So its just gonna be Blitz, Yuumi, Fizz and Morgana every game. ARURF only partially solves the problem. Now its random which team is gonna be able to do anything remotely fun.
"But you have bans."
Yeah, 5 out of 148. Seems fair, right?
I played against yuumies yesterday. The funniest thing was that one of them went full tank and the rest were attached to her
Jhin has 5 skins tho...
Correct me if im wrong but is that new UI?
Demaccia
Just came here to say Taliyah has 2 skins that are pretty much the same

4440 more skins* so it's 4444
But why not go to Baron? Last night I was playing one for all, and both teams were even. However, we lost because, my teammates wouldn't go to baron and the other team took it.
\*for a tank\* 

that's the problem

you'd never say she deals a lot of damage compared to an adc or smth

I had two moments like this from yesterday's matches. The first one was a Fizz vs Malph match (damn I still feel ashamed for playing that annoying little...), and when one of the enemy Malphites had a double kill, a teammate said "report Fizz". In the second match I was playing with my friend and the enemy team was Nocturne. We were talking on Discord, and I randomly yelled NOC'S COMING, he was like wtf which one. Doesn't matter which one, our team was Blitzcrank so we had no chance.
I lost my interest in League

well yes, that is how I win lane against sylas
This would honestly be really annoying to play lol

Just run in, try to R E and W before you get nuked yourself
Lmao. 

Your initial statement misunderstood my joke.  You then claim that my claim was not grounded.  After proving you wrong twice, you pull this stunt.

Stop being so defensive.  You are literally changing the parameters of the joke.  I didn't specify a time period.  Arguing for the sake of argument.
yeah, but that is before not now
sylas' R has many issues during development, and was first released.  They had to remake many ults of different champions.  Had a specific segment talking about it.
I had 3 consecutive dodges just a few hours ago, can agree
Nobody gonna mention garen is female
Karthus r..
That really isn't as awful as it seems.

Taken from the perspective of money spent over time, you've only spent about 25€ per month since you started playing, which is about a little less than paying for 2 WoW Subscriptions for the same amount of time.
when was sylas known for that?
Gamebreaking as in bugs, not his intended gameplay
Happy cake day!

Yes, you can play for free, but you can't aquire champs like you used to. But new players wouldn't realize that if it's their first time.

Couldn't screenshot :(
Omg, just yesterday, someone voted for yuumi as a joke, and another person had the same idea, so we had to play yuumi vs sylas.The enemy team asked us if we wanted to do a most deaths world record, lol.

No one typed in all chat to all go mid. So playing all Blitz was an automatic to immediately go mid.
Pinging enemy summs...

Apparently every champ one plays is supposed to have Shen's R. Why wouldn't you be able to help somebody who simply fucked up from across the map.
It's always nice to reach minute 4 and see that one lane already died 3+ times. And if you are neither playing a meta pick nor have godlike mechanics yoursself, you should probably stay away from these kinds of lanes....
DEMACIAAA!!??
How can garen get 29/0 why diana only get 15/0 ?
Recently played as sett vs ezreal and it was the ultimate hunks vs twinks war of all time
Idk about older time, but you can 100% play league for free now. 
And if u don't know, u can buy like 2-3 champions with 6300 cost right away after making a new account.
But was does that have to do with Dark Star vs. Cosmic, where both sides have heightened abilities. In a setting where beings have godlike powers, you don’t need to be a genius to be powerful.  Once again, idk how intelligence plays that much of a factor into this scenario. You can’t outsmart a black hole hurling towards you. You’d be ripped in half and become spaghetti. How is creation supposed to beat destruction when the goal is to destroy the other?

edit: Also, how can you say only smart people can create when champions like Aphelios exist. It’s stupid game design to make a champion that’s that complex and hard to balance. It’s a meme at this point, but I can think of many other counter arguments. For example. if only smart people create, why is there need to inspect inventions and equipment? Your statement is way too flawed, you believe in an idealistic reality that is far out of the realm of possibility.
Where can I find this actual episode?
One for all isnt about balance
Cringe
Oh i didnt thought u were flaming me I just added arguemnts over yours. I am totally with you on that
As a talon main, I agree
Oh sorry if it read like Im flaming you, no Im just sick of all these "Korean Builds".
Well just to say even heizman(high elo lee sin main) lost hard against us in high gold(low elo). Just to say no matter how good you are stop trolling games by thinking because he won one game of it it becomes OPOP. I mean I kinda feel bad about the guy who was in is platinium promo that lost lmfao
Man, I had a 1/7/0 yi one game, he farmed to blood razor, rageblare and BorK then carried.
My friend accidentally misspelled veigar "neiger" (the n was a miskey and he legit thought veigar was er.) He's banned for 2 weeks. Rito dont mess around. He was still shit talking so I dont feel too bad. He just ain't racist.
Poppy deals a lot of damage tbh.
Thats what I hate about these "Korean Builds".
The people who do this are just good at their champion. That it works for them means fucking nothing for the general playerbase.
Heck, Tyler1 carried with Draven Jungle. That doesnt mean that its hidden OP or even optimal. He is just way too good at this champion.
Please for the love of god, stop imitating Challenger and Korean Builds just because they say its "Hidden OP" or "Freelo" (god I hate this word).
You can't tell which Darius you are pinging at the game as well. It is more hilarious when someone gets tilted and rage ping, but no one knows who he is targeting.
Ohh lol just noticed xd
Ive done it before on PBE! It was hectic. Team with tank, supp tank, AD/AS and AP blitz won. Our team only had ap and supp builds. Lot of hookers.

Imagine complaining about a purely cosmetic purchasable  thing in a game 100% free to play.
I now realized that that splash art is basically in the same pose as the original splash art. Could make a decent meme format
so what? the elo exists and different strategies have to be followed to survive it
Meh, Gnar is kinda ok as range, but dear god not even Ornn tanks as much as mega Gnar, thank god it has a time limit.
I always try to all in, if I don't kill them with it I'm dead 70% of the time.
well that's a bronze detected
Oh god a whole game of pure blitz I wish i could've seen that
I mean, it's probably the same person.
Well yesterday was probably one of the most fun games I've had. It was OFA all mid Blitz both sides were Blitz and it was a fucking clown fiesta. We were supposed to go Yuumi but someone banned it and the other team also said they were going for Yuumi if she wasn't banned. We lost but that was fun af.

Fun fact I started playing season 9

nice repost retard
Did this in my Mord match today
The duality of Yasuo. It is like a Schrodinger cat. Is it dead? Is it alive? It is both at the same time.
I main Gnar, and this hurts me.
It's kinda that that makes it difficult to go up against yasuo players, Some do no damage and get killed instantly and others zoom around all over the place while one shotting everything. Very strange
I am pretty close to silver 1 promos and as soon as i get that gold fam i am never playing ranked again. until next season lol.

Tho with the added iron rank, gold is kinda like the new plat

Instructions still unclear: got collapsed on trying to ward pixel as teammate kept csing and ignored my pings
Yeah it goes off % who picked each. Basically everyone throws a piece of paper in a cup with their desired champ name on it, and computer randomly selects one paper lol

I had one game last time one for all came around and I was solo grouped with a 4 man premade that all picked the same champ they all agreed on, while I jokingly said in chat, "we're playing lee sin guys."

I about fell out of my chair laughing when we went into game as lee sin.
Yeah they’re way too salty there 

I tried to tell my team to group up and one person with his premades started insulting and then muted me

I knew someone would spot what I really meant
Well this game came to a point where almost every champ is broken in some way. I need 50 bans at least to have a fun game. then again there is the community.

welp, sorry to break it to ya but ya got shit taste
It's all percentages I believe so the only way of being sure you're gonna play certain champion is having everyone in your team vote for it
From my experience it’s a bunch of ragers complaining about the picks and either give up or just afk.

I'm playing a ton of Quinn - who I'm learning is a snowball type champion.

I play a little Kayle and I own Malphite, Cho Gath, Riven, and Poppy.
Your questions overall are kinda difficult to answer, atleast shortly. They depend too much on different variables. (Or I'm just too tired to write/read/think in english.)

But I feel like you worry about wrong things, it kinda isn't your job as adc to worry about splitpushers especially on Ashe.

You should just try to get best out of situation given to you. For example, if your top groups and ignores splitpusher (maybe they can't stop splitpusher alone, or are just incompetent) you could try use your R to start 5v4 fight.

> If dragon is coming up in 30 seconds and there is a huge wave top,

Just go to drake if your team is gonna fight for it.

While farming is important, you have to remember that it doesn't win games. It gets you gold and experience which job is to make winning easier, but those aren't only things that can make winning easier. There is also for example: map pressure and teammates mental. Sometimes it's better to do "wrong" thing, if it prevents your teammate from tilting.
If the chain breaks nothing happens, if you stay in range he pulls you towards himself. Not strictly a stun but yes you can’t move as you like during that duration
yea cs/min is based on char and game state. if you have no map control, then you will naturally have less cs / min because u arent catching sides + farming jg camps.

champs like trynd that are always splitting + farm jg camps super fast will naturally have higher cs because they are constantly farming something

Honestly toplane is the most forgiving role. Jungle bassicly decides if you win, mid helps the jungler and botlane win, support determines the pace of botlane and adc will win or loose you the game. In terms of laners, what do you play rn?
The reason she became weak as an adc was the nerf to her range. She ended with lowest attack range, tied with Lucian, which meant that instead of being a lane bully that can kite around on the edge of auto range using her passive, she needs to always be in auto range of her opponents to do damage. Meanwhile toplane is guys like Sett, Darius and Garen, who get kited to hell and back, or tanks like Ornn and Malphite who die to Botrk. So Kalista top is able to be a lane bully again, and actually hits a decent powerspike off of bortk.
Waiting for the shard to get mastery 6
>However from there the game is dictated on whether or not my teammates fed.

Yep. That's literally everyone right now lol... but it's always been the case for late game champs. If the game closes out before you can get going... well too bad... It's the price you pay for that "late game power fantasy"

Most games are over at about 25 minutes. Kayle doesn't really start to shine until about 30-35 minutes. So yea... the meta is a bit fast for her. Once she gets there she can take over but... well that's IF she gets there.

>Similar story with Nasus

Nasus is a midgame champ not a lategame but I can understand the confusion there. He either punishes his opponents super hard or he becomes useless. Nasus is more about game knowledge and knowing your limits than anything else.

>some better success with Veigar mid

That's because Veigar starts to come online earlier than Kayle. He also has really strong CC which, in a meta lacking of tanks and peel, is very valuable. Midlane is just so mobile that he struggles there. But... well if you play him top you've gotta be really smart. There's so much damage up there and you're basically alone due to how gank heavy bot lane is. So... I'd only do this into a matchup I'm more comfortable with personally.

To answer your question... yes (Edit: Kinda, you don't have to do anything and the champs are functional but being at the mercy of the clock makes your winrate more unreliable). Damage is EVERYTHING right now. The meta is super coin flippy and whoever makes the pick gets the win. Sure scalers are cool but almost all peel is substituted for engage atm. When's the last time you've even seen a peel support like Taric or Braum? lol! Right now... Picks + damage + mobility = Win.
Use your best game. There is still A TON to improve in many aspects you don't even know that exist. This way, your coach won't lose too much time teaching you stuff you already know but in that game didn't execute properly. If you show him a game in which you can't find your mistakes, then he will teach you new stuff you didn't know. If you show him a bad game, the coach will waste too much time telling "well in this situation don't fight because he's stronger, look at the items" and you will be "well, ok". These basics you get by playing, coaching is useful not only to remember you the basics, but mostly to teach you new things.
toplane is being dominated by immobile juggernauts and kalista is good counter to them

once top meta goes back to drivers (irelia, camille, riven and so on) and mages she will dissapear
It's more effective to use Biscuits first yes. And then pots.
Didnt know. Dont play botrk champs. Either way she started getting a ton more picks post hp buff, they gave her same hp as melee bruisers

Hob buff was patch after iirc
Ew, a teemo player.
botrk buffs were melee only though
Not all late game carries have terrible early and mid games, those ones are good still
I've literally never had an issue ganking before 3
Learning how to CS...

1. Start with the basics
   1. Start a Custom Game (or training mode). Put 1 bot in there (ranged). The bot usually goes to bot lane. Sit in mid lane and just CS until 100 without using ANY abilities. You should get perfect CS every time. Do this until you're very comfortable at auto attack timings. Remember, different champs do have different auto timings and ranges... this matters.
2. Introduce trading Pt 1.
   1. Review the trading stance. Video is old but gold  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iko2tqmDpJQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iko2tqmDpJQ)
   2. Using the trading stance... do step 1 while ALSO trading properly with a beginner bot. Do not just run up to them knowing that they are pushovers. Treat them like a real threat and trade on them only when they go for a CS but it WOULD NOT force you to lose a CS. You can use abilities on the Bot but DOT NOT use abilities on the farm.
3. Introduce trading Pt 2.
   1. Same as step 2 but with an intermediate bot. More aggressive (make sure the bot is ranged). You may not get perfect CS this time. At this point you should be thinking about what CS is safe and which ones will get you Lux E'd in the face. You should also start keeping track of enemy ability cooldowns. Aim for at least 90% CS.
4. Try against a Player.
   1. Review the Trading stance again [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iko2tqmDpJQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iko2tqmDpJQ)
   2. Go into a blind or draft and try this agianst a player. DO NOT attempt to get perfect CS... go for safe CS. Trade when it is plausible to do so but most importantly... be patient.

CSing takes time to develop the muscle memory. Be patient and you'll get comfortable over time. Do not try to rush things as if you can't hit your autos on cannons 90% of the time you're just gonna end up frustrated that you suck at CSing.
It sucks to have a jungler camping your lane, but if the enemy jungler is camping your lane, it means the enemy jungler can’t gank your other lanes. So if you can successfully draw the jungler to your lane and not die to a gank, that is a huge win for your team. 

I also struggle with not dying to ganks, that is something that you have to review your vods or get coached on to see what you are doing wrong.
When you walk away from his rope it stuns you I’m pretty sure. But yeah after reading this I think I’m just going to perma ban him. He’s so annoying. Thanks for the tips tho.
Just learn to back and itemize properly. Shoving and roaming is still a fundamental you learn on Annie and so is wave management. You don't need to learn Annie to learn a burst mage, pick up something like Oriana or veigar for that. You're also better off learning other champs to learn the control mage style where you're permanently wave clearing and denying space for your team.

Annie is recommended to get bronze 4s to like silver 4 and gold 4. It's literally advice on how to stop drooling on your keyboard and play the game. The main reason this is good advice is because you don't get lost in the micro with Annie since she's so simple. 

If you really wanted to get better at mid lane you'd learn to play jungle on top of learning mid picks for assassin, control, burst, and carry mid laners. This way you learn to better play the map not only on your own power spikes, but on the maps objectives and your junglers decision making.
maybe take the lane xp without taking the gold. its his minions. help him push but dont alst hit
If you deserve a higher elo, you will take over the game regardless of inters sometimes(sometimes you will lose, yes. Accepting this is part of climbing). The other times when you don't have inters, you will *absolutely* take over the game if you're a dominant player.

If you're not a dominant player who takes over games, then yes, the system will never ever send you up but instead you will seesaw and coinflip wins and losses. Start dominating, and you will climb. Simple as that.
You cant really permafreeze once you have passive waveclear like tiamat or bamis, you can hold the minions there for a couple of waves but it will eventually slowpush to your enemy.

About using tp, early drakes are usually just not worth it (imo some people have other ideas) the only drakes that matter are the 3rd and 4th so i usually ignore the first 2 unless i can get something more than just the drake
33 fuckin %
Frankly there's not much but I'll elaborate.

Games a bit snowbally right now that's for sure. I'm assuming that you're just fighting endless hordes of Sett, Darius, Garen, and Wukongs. Now, bot lane is getting swarmed a lot because of the dragon changes and well... it's easy. Junglers are frequently bot so as soon as they appear the more aggressive Top laner goes to town and you end up in a situation where your Top gets abandoned, their top is mega fed, and you die to a light breeze.

Since one of the major weaknesses of ADC is that you have little to no control of the macro game... the best thing you can really do at that level is ping for dragon at every possible chance, take bot turret first (hopefully), and move mid to pressure. You're gonna want to play a really solid teamfighter as damage is so high right now... you won't survive getting breathed on by a butterfly and it's REALLY hard to peel right now. There are VERY few viable tanks right now so again... peel is rough. You either catch someone, engage on them, and blow people up or you'll die. That's just how this meta is... Honestly it does feel a bit more "coin flip" than usual to me but... here we are. 

So... sum up. Win bot faster to pressure more, Take more drag, play teamfighters, DO NOT GET CAUGHT... EVER. Sucks but that's really it. Sorry.
She is strong only if you powerfarm
She is not, she is a powerfarmer so try to player more like yi and less like lee
I always try to ask my adc to play a certain way, and I very rarely get a negative response. Maybe there's something wrong with the way your saying it?
Well, that's what separates good players from bad ones. High ranked players had to put a lot of work to get to where they are. That's what gives those ranks value. Your suggestion is good to teach players, but like I said, ranked is meant to be a test of skill.

That's true for the farming junglers that rely on auto attacks. 

The spell based ones typically have better ganking.  
Stuffs like Hecarim, Evelynn, Kayn, or even Morgana and Brand (with their recent jungle buffs) fit this category.
Kled is an incredible early game bully. His whole shtick is that once he's on you, you can't easily get him off. He is indeed a great roamer. 

Now, I don't recall Kled having a stun... He has a pull, a slow, and a knockup thing on his ult (maybe that's what you meant?) but that's it.

So... beating Kled. First off... Treat Kled like a Darius. He usually builds just Raw AD as his starting item... pokes from range with Q. Gets level 2 and just flings himself at you. Darius does the same kind of thing. Encourage auto trades with his W and passive (he wins) and then rope you in at level 2 or 3 and just wipe the floor with you. Deny Kled his early game cheese or cheese him harder. 

If you're squishy it's best to NOT push a Kled as he can close distances very quickly.

Kled does not scale well... as the game goes on he becomes less and less a fighter and more of a tank/engage. All the more reason to deny him his early game.

If Kled disappears after 6... ping people, namely mid. They probably won't listen but do it anyway. Kled will either all in you or roam every time his ult is up... after all he's on the clock. He's gotta win sooner than later. (Fitting to the characters personality... he's not a patient Yordle).

Don't panic... his ult will track you until it hits. Once it his THEN you can flash to get away from him. Extra mobility helps if you have it (as always).
It doesn't need to be Annie. You should have a mage though that you play into certain matchups. There will be times that you probably shouldn't pick an assassin into your mid matchup and a ranged mage will be better. Just find someone that works for you, maybe with good wave clear...
Ok so, I've played about 30 games over the last week. I have had, and I'm not exaggerating, THE worst luck I've ever had in this game. 1 in 3 of my games has an afk. I have won lane in probably 25 of my games, pretty hard. Usually 3 to 4 kills up and 30 cs up in gold. Of those games where I do well, more than half of them have a top laner that is just straight up inting. I'm talking, 0/6 by 15 mins. I'm really starting to question if there is something wrong with the match making at this point. It seems like I'm playing at about a plat level, when my team is all in bronze. Every season I've made it to high gold or plat pretty easily, and usually stop there. But I am having a really hard time wrapping my head around whats going on. Is anyone else experiencing this? Ever game I say, "don't int and i will carry." I dumpster my lane, and by the time laning is over, the game is already lost because of top. What can I do as adc? Doesn't seem like there is a solution. Most games I lose and get an S rating. Usually have over 10 kills, less than 3 deaths. I hit 5 items by 20 mins but literally can't do anything vs the insanely fed top laner. What do I do?
It's mainly the changes to hail of blades. You get those 3 free quick autos to retreat or kite forward and you dont have to be out of combat to have it rest. That coupled with top being a lot of low mobility brawlers makes her fairly safe and pretty much cancer.
Try asking for advise on r/shyvanamains
i really mean learn the same things a beginner (cs, vision .etc) but with champions like kata and zed
You feel squishy going full dmg autoattack based build? Well duh

If you want to be tanky youd get tank items after jg item or jg item and partial 2nd dmg item.

If you build like that you are strictly playing to farm and duel and splitpush. Also her ap builds are far better in general, shes great atm, her early game is her only downside
She got big hp buffs
Can't tell if this is irony, but that's really not how the game works.
dont play gangplank lol try garen
She shits on popular toplaners, like sett due to her high mobility and early bully capabilities while still scaling well.

As for bot, other adcs were nerfed out, and she has great synergy with current popular supports.
GP is one of the hardest champions in the game and it is said the diamond GP mains don’t even play him right half of the time. Pick a strong splitpusher (like tryndamere) and propel your self to bronze / silver via splitpushing
Tahm Kench with fasting Senna is actually a strong strat right now. But other than that he’s pretty garbage. 

If you like the assassin shove and roam strat but need a champ that can dominate lane, I recommend Ahri.
I'll attempt to explain then...

Yes. "At a base level," which is a longsword and an amp tome. That is the base level. We use that to set the baseline for the analysis. 

BF sword gives us 40 AD. If 1 AD is worth 35 gold. Then 40 AD is worth 1400 gold. BF sword is 1300 gold. Therefore BF sword has 108% (rounded) gold efficiency.

Blasting Wand gives us 40 AP. If 1 AP is worth 21.75 than 40 AP is worth 870 gold. Blasting wand is 850 gold. Therefore Blasting Wand has 102% gold efficiency.

108% > 102%. So BF is more gold efficient than Blasting wand.
Ahhh see, that's where the misunderstanding is. You'll often hear the term 'attention **span**'. We take this word for granted, because our idea of attention is like... focusing, on one thing, and if our focus breaks, that's bad attention. But that's **not** what attention is limited to. Attention is the ability to focus on **multiple** things, this is the 'span' in question. What you call "hyper focus", is actually just tunnel vision, if you think about it.
I do, good tip though!
Your ganks are pretty trash pre-6 so you can only gank when they're super pushed up so you don't need sweeper then, post-6 your invisibility lets you ignore stealth wards, and using sweeper just shows your hand on a gank, plus you can safely put deep wards in the enemy jungle. I bring pinks for baron/dragon anyway so I just keep yellow trinket for almost the entirety of the game. Sometimes I switch to blue based on context
I think most of the things are already mentioned but for question 4 you can buy a pink ward. I‘m a support main and when I have a look at the vision score at the end of games (in your elo) it often happens that adc has no single pink ward placed in the game. So if you don‘t buy pinks do it in the next games. :)
the fact that both supports didn't buy a single pink ward in a 32 min game hurts my eyes. and nami did the most damage among 10 people, including lux. im more than just confused.
because theyre inputting commands between messages
Thank you! This made much more sense than the last comment lol tysm
Honestly you should just play Anivia to counter him. His w doesn’t block the second proc, easy disengage with wall, and you can easily out push him once you have the mana.
Graves, Elise, Olaf, and Xin Zhao come to mind. They do a good amount of dmg early and have the tools needed to 1v1 the other jungler at level 3.

Graves can easily kite, can cheese with his W, a partial reload on his E, and can easily pop his Q in the jungle. 

Elise can easily proc Electrocute and can kill at level 2 without even needing her E. Her human Q does damage based on current health whereas her spider form Q does missing health dmg. In spider form, she has an attack speed boost on her W. She can easily stick to the other jungler and can kill really fucking fast.

Olaf is just Olaf. If he lands a Q, you are fucked.

Xin has a 3 hit passive that does bonus dmg alongside his Q 3 hit knockup. Combine this with HoB and Xin can easily win a duel just off of that ability. His W slows and does dmg. Pretty easy ability to land on a target that you just knocked up. His E is a dash that slows on top of that.
\*Exerts kill pressure on a cooldown
>At a base level, 1 point of AD is worth 35 gold and 1 point of AP is worth 21.75 gold

that doesnt mean anything.  Youre saying AD is more gold efficient because ad is more gold efficient.  All youre saying is longsword costs 350 and amp tome costs 435.  There is no basis for cross stat comparison.
I mean he has one of the best escapes against duelers unless he gets bursted. This also doubles as the best positioning skill on a jungler (gank, escape *and* heal) on par with Camille even. This is very important because he is an assassin always looking for kill conversions rather than lane domination. He has a better Zhonyas in his R to avoid cc or burst and then sweep in with his own burst to clean up.
In a word, Sett. He's an amazing frontline champion that can be played virtually anywhere. I strongly believe he's still overtuned. 

Because of this... the meta is moving around. Supports in pro have favored tanky champions for years now... as their games end too quickly to get full use out of enchanter items (even if they are insanely gold efficient). That's why Nautilus (and Sett) is everywhere. Sylas is also a pretty beefy boy and can steal high impact Tank ults invalidating their need. Furthermore the meta is all about ganking bot and snowballing off of picks.

With Naut, Sett, and Sylas every game... you don't need to have a beefy boy top lane. You need only someone who is self sufficient. Kalista is ranged, is incredibly annoying, can facilitate ganks and kite for herself very well. 

It isn't that Kali is "good". She's just filling a niche since there's no need for tanks right now. You're just using her range to be annoying and using her ult to assist in picks.
I feel like it would only be good in extremely specific circumstances on an ADC. The only place I could see buying it is if the other team has both AD and AP burst threats, little CC, and I can't fit 2 defensive items in to the build. If they have CC they can hit you with merc scim is probably better. If they don't have CC and you are primarily worried about 1 type of damage then GA or Maw is probably better. Obviously building multiple defensive items (besides PD) can be really rough though. If I was against both AP and AD threats with no CC I could maybe see it being an okay buy, but its mostly just mixed defense and life steal. The 40 AD or whatever hardly matters compared to crit, on-hit, or pen items.

Basically I would only think its good if you were considering building 2 defensive items otherwise and normally you wouldn't do that.
i mean he isn't the only juggernaut, you got Darius who is honestly a low elo stomper, there are ppl who 1 trick Darius (and Garen) to Diamond 
Things like Nasus are also low elo stompers because they eventually become unkillable 

Like here's the thing you have to get, most of your games in low elo like that aren't going to snowball and end after 20 minutes. So picking a snowbally champ is like really not great, you just have to understand that most of your games are going to last long so you have to have 1) better understanding of how to take objectives, 2) how to play around vision and 3) how to actually win in spite of your team. 

If you are playing Wukong or Camille top even if you happen to snowball the same result is going to happen eventually; You will go in, press R and get focused down and then your team will die as well because they were in a 4 v 5; Camille and Wu are best used when there are other engage threats but also when your team understand how to pressure objectives, and generally speaking you aren't going to get that until plat or maybe gold. So taking Camille or Wu is like head scratching, like what do you expect to do? Win lane? OK and then what? Both those champs are super squishy, they have 1 thing they want to do and thats to isolate ppl, but if it's 5 v 5 you isolating  someone goes dramatically down, and if you don't know how to split push or to flank (which you prolly don't) then taking those champs is just not great. 

You want power picks with ease of execution, you don't want anything where you have to rely on your team too much to do what you want (although i would still ping)
It all depends on whether you hit your E. If you miss it, you lose most of your damage

Shyvana has no CC outside of a small knockback on her ultimate, so she relies purely on her damage to get through a fight. If you can't deal enough damage, you will feel weak. If you end up underfarmed, you won't have enough damage to make an impact
She actually has a 51.95% WR right now with a 2.61% PR.  So shes decently strong.  Shyvana plays similar to trundle with a higher emphasis on dragon.  You should be looking to power farm the jungle and invade a lot. Shyv has great clear speed all through the game and a great 1v1 potential.  Shyv struggles in temfights especially without tanks to support her as she has limited mobility and no cc.
I dont know why, but I always felt super squishy but at the same time not able to do damage when I played her as a bruiser.  Am I doing something wrong?  My build is Bloodrazor into Titanic, then I would go either wit's end, mallet, or dead mans depending on the game, but I've never made it that far because I've always lost before I could get my third item.
huh interesting. Thanks!
because you dont ward?
This is my second year of playing League (started around march of S9), and I'm currently Gold 4. I'm pretty proud of myself, but one thing I really want to improve is my champion pool. Currently, I'm mostly a mid/top main, with the occasional sprinkling of sup. My most played and best champs are Ahri, Akali, Morgana, Pantheon, and Vel'Koz for mid. For top, my curent best champs are Mordekaiser, alongside the previously mentioned Akali and Pantheon. 

Recently, I've been playing a lot of Pantheon, Akali, and Mordekaiser. I like these champs a lot because they can get a lead early on, and either snowball out of control or exert a lot of pressure with roams around the map. 

The only other important note I can currently think of is that I like spell based champions a lot more than champs that rely on autos. For example, when I have to play ADC, I prefer to play Ezreal over any other ADC because he feels the most like a mage. 

Any advice on who to play would be nice! :)

It isn't. It has a super low win rate. Just a handful of players are playing it top and are doing "ok" with it. Last I looked they were 50%.
Try every champ and hoe you have fun with the most that’s the champ

There is another side to this though. If your bot lane goes up 4-0 and then has to play lane 2v4 for an extended period it really helps if the jg shows up to save tower. I can't tell you how often I'm smashing bot lane, outplay a gank or two, and then end up 2v4 or 2v5 for an extended period and we lose tower and sometimes die. You aren't going to get kills elsewhere on the map because everyone is in bot lane. Sure you can take some plates somewhere else, but the laners can do that themselves and you won't get turret before the 2v4 or 5 lane.

Edit: And to be clear its hard to not be a target as an ADC. If you have anything less than perfect vision and step out from under tower, or sometimes even if you don't step out from under tower, you are an easy kill for most champions in the game even if you are fed.

So I guess to answer your first question I ran like 10 games on wukong and i was really feeling his kit, went 32-4 in draft and then like a 4 winstreak. I'm sure it was mostly luck and because norms are easy and low intensity, but I decided to play wukong. Youre probably right about him being too difficult for me to play and need better awareness but in this specific matchup i got first blood and went 3-1 at around 7 minutes. I play camille because no one can really deal with her once i hit my Trinity powerspike. Overall im not trying to inflate my skill but I genuinely believe I can outduel people using Camille because I lose primarily to super fed champs. But I will take your advice and try to learn easier champions like garen which i played but feel like I have even less impact.

WW main here.  
The good boy lives and breathes kill pressure. It's another bug at the back of your mind if the enemy team has Warwick and you get whittled down by the enemy laner so now you can be hunted. You know that if you are low and go for that trade with your opponent that you will win but what if so close to victory you are afraid, terrified even, a monster rampaged out of the fog and no matter how much you harm him he seems to be getting stronger as your essence gushes free and as if preying on your weakness, the beast only grows stronger! Your feet aren't quick enough so you channel divinity and flash away but - it *knows* you will, *blood runs, they all run* \- there he is next to you and you are weaker still. Hope crumbles and as if to mock your helplessness, it sears you with an azure bolt of incandescence that only slows you down further. You had heard that they fear it, ***they should.***

Yep
Sorry, I should've specified, we mean Ad and Ap items as the sum of all their components, including actives and other stats. Would this mean that Ad edges out with respect to a full build?
I play a lot of AP mages support. And I feel like Annie's kit is just underwhelming. Her range is so damn low. If you can land a sweet stun tibbers that's nice. But you have to practically be in mele range.
Another thing to add is just because you have high vision score doesn’t necessarily mean they were good wards. You can spam wards all day in bot lane bush for a high score but it doesn’t really give your team info later in the game. Make sure you place wards in areas so you can necessary info so that the team gains an advantage
He's really hard to play but oh boy you'll get a blast if you try out Gangplank top or mid !  
Honestly the most fun champ to play imo but he's really hard to master and he's got quite the hard matchups when not good at him. He's worth the investment tho, trust me.
Support isn't really a role where you lose the game if someone gets autofilled to it anymore in comparison to an autofilled jungler so that wouldn't be my concern. If you think you can climb playing midlane that it can be worth giving it a shot you'll likely not lose because your support didn't carry bottom lane but for a variety of other reasons. That being said support is still a role where you can have a massive impact on the game depending on how well you play. Supports still climb just as easily as other roles whether they do it through vision or initiation.  


If you want to do it to play mid feel free it wont have that much impact on the game if you can play midlane well enough. People will get autofilled but that can happen regardless of whether you opt into support.
In strictly terms of gold efficiency. The result will depend on the context. 

No completed item gives you JUST a flat AD or AP boost... they give you all sorts of other stuff. You'd have to cut out all that extra stuff's gold value... but in the end it'll be the same. 1 point of AD costs more than 1 point of AP, so AP items give you more AP for cheaper. Making them more efficient.

HOWEVER, If you try to count ALL of those stats to **compare just the items**... it starts to favor AD items. Since the pricepoint tends to hover around the same (game pacing balance)... take Essense Reaver vs Luden's Echo. Because they are 3300 and 3200 gold respectively... but ER gives CDR, Crit chance, and mana regen with 70AD... The AD alone is like 2450 gold, CDR and Crit are both quite valuable and I wouldn't even know how to calculate the Mana regen on hit because it's a %. 

In contrast, Ludens gives 90 AP (1957.5g)  CDR (same amount in the end) and mana... which I believe is the lowest value stat in the game at 1.4g per point of mana. With a little bit of extra burst damage (low value). 

Luden's is clearly inferior to ER in terms of Gold efficiency because the price points are similar. The reason the price points are similar is to facilitate midgame teamfights and clear powerspikes. So here... AD items become more efficient.
When you'd play marksman top 2 seasons ago you'd be trolling but now "thAt'S THe MeTA". What the hell's the deal anyway ? Why can't I just go back to Full Armor Malphite ?
Roaming is a part of Laning, and understanding how to punish roams is paramount in understanding why and when to roam. Previously, it seems you have been roaming without reason. Or as my favorite description goes; you have just been punching as if it's just a punch, a punch must be  more than just a punch before it goes back to being a punch. In other words, you just roamed for the sake of roaming, never understanding when or why it is necessary. It is often repeated that to truly get better at something you have to hit the fundamentals, and this is the reason why, it lets you achieve the reason for your punch.
You played Wukong how many times? like honestly, if you've played a champ 5 times in norms and went 3-2 (and you are iron) you shouldn't be bringing it into ranked. 

&#x200B;

In Ranked you bring YOUR BEST CHAMPS! I think this is the part where ppl don't understand, you aren't bringing a champ that you popped off with once or twice in norms, you are bringing a champ that you are 100% confident and know how to win with on. 

I don't doubt that your team mates int'd that's part of being in Iron, that's why you bring your best Suit to the Show! Cause I guarantee at least 2 of your team mates will INT! You have to know how to carry despite them inting. 

&#x200B;

The reason you lost was because you didn't play your best champ, that's all there is to it. 

If you played your best champ and you lost then hey man maybe you can put some blame on your mates, or maybe you can say you deserve being iron. If you played a champ you have no real proficiency on (and by that I mean at least 50 games played with a positive WR, assuming it's not a super difficult champ and then it would need prolly like 100 games in norms) then it's just as much your fault considering you couldn't provide enough pressure to allow your team to do anything. 

Wukong isn't a difficult champ or anything but remember, you are still fairly new, and you aren't a pro or challenger; literally all of us think we are better than we are but at least we play champs that we have a lot of experience on, you picked wukong cause you thought he was overtuned atm and sure i suppose in some elo's he is but honestly in Iron basically everything is OP if you are good at it. Annie, Malzhar, fucking Maokai, like that's just off the top of my head, those things go hard in Iron, even Brand is another one. I remember I played against a Few Iron 2 ppl and I felt like it was like playing against new ppl tbh, they are so bad it makes Silver players look good; literally all you have to do is play your best champ and you will get out of iron and bronze pretty easily! 

Like honestly your champ pool is the prob as well, i'm sorry but things like Camille shouldn't be played in iron or bronze or even silver, you should find some new champs to play tbh and put camille on the back burner till you get better at the fundamentals;  Like honestly I doubt you play her well, i doubt you play wukong well, both of those champs are super aggro; like you have to play them where you go in, blow all your abilities and then get out; or finding ways to poke down the other champs (which is even harder) 

Pick simple champs with clear advantages and ease of execution, like what in the shit are you doing picking camille in iron? even in bronze i'd say you are trolling; Play the Juggernauts or the few tanks that are good, simple in the top lane; playing fighters in low elo is just asking for pain and disappointment. Fighters are some of the hardest champs to consistently win with and a lot has to do with execution! 

I'm sorry to say this, but you deserve Iron / Bronze and you haven't really understood why your picks don't work yet, that's why you'll stay there.
Yea old dd maybe, but new dd was pushed strictly into the bruiser category. The defensive stats don’t do much on an adc, an assassin now goes from blowing you up in .5 seconds to .7, either way you still die. GA while yea it has cd it can grant a huge reprieve if you are picked and killed but your team can follow up and protect you after you rise.
What gets me is Ashe ADC that hold on to R like it's the last dollar in the bank. Ashe/Brand bot lane, both have Ults up, enemy pushed past mid lane poked down to 50-70% better just hold on to it. But they have no problem at all throwing it across the entire fucking map to try and land that sweet sweet snipe top lane.
mute, it’s not their minions, it’s your teams minions.  The same mid laner pinging you for taking a creep will be taking your raptors 15 mins later.
Weird, every time I even politely try to ask my support to play up more or do anything differently I just get flamed for my bad CS because I've obviously got bad CS in a 1v2 lane. If there is anything I've learned recently its actually that typing is almost always a bad thing. Even polite suggestions are usually responded to by flame. Constructive criticism is not appreciated by anywhere near the majority of players. I'd say typing anything to a support playing badly is the worst possible thing you can do in my experience.
Yeah Neeko is pretty good vs melee but not that great against ranged as long as Neeko doesn't take you by surprise.

However high mobility melee champs can still win if they bait out the root first. For example, as Akali i was destroying a Neeko by first baiting out her E and then all in her.
 Unpopular opinion, make new account or obtain new account go full trollmode on ranked/normals whatever you have access and just have fun. Remember to mute your "team" and just do and play whatever the heck you want and listen to good music. Few games of this relaxing style should get you back on track or just take break and play some other game.
As lucian you are probably just completely screwed. With other ADCs you have to just take whatever scraps you can and try to scale later. Also if you try to make any suggestion to your support prepare to get flamed for your low CS that is caused by their bad play.

I play both ADC and support and both positions you can hard lose lane because of the other player. When the ADC is the one losing the lane for bot its usually because they can't dodge anything and position poorly and get engaged on. When supports lose the lane for bot its usually because they play way back and force their ADC to try to 1v2 lane. I have more time on support than ADC, but I've been playing more ADC recently and whenever I try to make suggestions to my support even politely I just get flamed for my CS so I don't even try to make suggestions anymore. It only makes things worse and players that are bad enough to play way too passively are probably autofilled, and definitely won't actually play well because you let them know you can't lane with them so far back and need them to step forward and at least look threatening.
If you're looking for a new lane, I love playing Shen and kled top lane.
yeah thats what i think as well it was a mistake trying to pick melee into her because even though i might win a straight up 1v1 as kat the landing would be awful
I assure you Syndra is anything BUT a cheese pick. I would even consider her stronger than 90% of traditional adcs and would def advise playing her over them in lower elo. She is stronger at every point other than lvl1 and verly late game and her only real weaknesses compared to adcs are killing tanks and sieging (which at that elo doesnt matter, so effectively 1 weak point).
Also due to being a mage, she is naturally less dependant on team which is what u want.
Build her as a bruiser and she’s . Just have to learn how her kit works
Whenever i play Neeko, anything with extra range (Ezreal, Varus, Xerath, etc.) is pretty annoying to play against since i can't land the EQ combo if they're not in range. Also ganks are pretty effective since once Neeko uses her root on one of you, the other can fight her. Keep in mind that Neeko with 45% CDR can uses the root every 6 sec. or so and hiding behind minions doesn't work like it does for Lux and Morgana for example.

As an extra tip: Try to pay attention to the rest of the enemy team. If Neeko is camouflaged as an ally her R will not show the startup animation and once you realize she's ulting it's too late. If you see a particular enemy twice on the minimap, look out. Also watch out for ambushes because Neeko can one shot squishy champs if she lands her R Q E combo and maybe a few autos to finish them off.

EDIT: I just thought of this. Nidalee is a really good counter against her. She has the spears to attack from range. Those spears apply "hunted" marks. That mark only shows on the actual Neeko when she uses her W and Neeko is usually very squishy so all you really have to do is land a spear, dodge the root and she is easily killable with the cougar WEQ combo.
Thanks that's really interesting! Do you think that this means that fully completed Ap items end up being more gold efficient than fully completed Ad items? I know this is incredibly generalized....
Thanks for the advice. Sadly I can‘t dodge for my adc haha and the spellshield has high cd early but yeah I skill it up if necessary. Often my main problem is my adc getting engaged because they have cc that goes trough minions and then I try to counter engage on (hopefully) their adc but they are staying into their minions what’s not so cool if you’re Morgana /: When I try to walk up my adc either goes out or is already dead. So I‘m always wondering what I can do better if my adc getting focused I give him spellshield and he‘s getting caught again 10 seconds later when my spellshield is still on cd and a counter „engage“ is not so easy because of better positioning of the enemy adc than my. I try to stay a little bit in front of my adc and rather play aggressive but not too aggressive.

Another thing is objectives like Drake. It feels like 3 out of 4 persons in Silver / Gold giving a fuck about them. I always ping (a minute earlier  /  30 secs earlier) and try to build vision (deep warding but not always possible if no enemy’s showing up on the map and nobody wants to help me). Most of the time it ends up that everyone ignores my pings doesn’t mind the vision because they don’t look at the map anyways and letting the enemy’s getting free drakes over and over till the 4th one and then my team starting fights 3vs5. I had 2 games in a row where the lanes went fine and the team fights where good but because of the lack of objectives and team organisation we lost... I just can’t help it in such situations I feel so ignored and useless :(

And? You still need to put some pressure on them that you will engage or the lane is fucked. Does the other support having any form of CC now make engage completely nullified? I must have missed that memo.
At a base level, 1 point of AD is worth 35 gold and 1 point of AP is worth 21.75 gold.

Armor items tend to be more costly than MR items as well, but still pretty close if I recall correctly.

Because of this, BF sword (40 AD) is technically more efficient gold wise than Blasting wand (40 AP)... but costs significantly more (1300 vs 850).

Now my number may be off slightly but I think the end result will be the same... AD is more expensive than AP so technically... AP is more gold efficient as you can get more of it for less.
A lot of the farming junglers are also good duelists because they have some sort of attack speed or healing mechanic. E.G. Yi, Trundle, Olaf, Sett, Udyr.
Okay that makes sense! Thank you!
ignore bot lane, focus on dragons. you cant fix idiots
Thanks a lot for the advice. Sadly I don‘t play Zyra (I‘m not good with her / didn’t enjoy her). But I play Morgana (if she isn’t banned). What do you think about Leona against that combo?  

Do you have some advice for the wave management against them? Because for example the Ezrael game ... I tried to help him pushing against them early so he doesn’t has to sit under tower getting harassed and loosing farm. I placed my w under the minions + at least one enemy (only if the minions are full life and I don‘t max w). But everytime I hit minions he pings me and writes „I can‘t farm if you hit minions“ and yeah he really missed everything. But his wave management was awful und we just get pushed and pushed nobody cares and ezrael even blamed me when I hit minions under tower (for example a full life range minion = 1 tower shot + 2 aa before items ...). I didn’t denied them and he also hasn’t hit them by himself / only has 1 q, so I really don‘t get what he wants?? It ended up him dying because my E has so much cd early and can’t block every engage + they‘re pushing + jhin had 85cs when ezrael had 50cs ... 

I really don’t now what I should do on such a lane? And I often have this problem when playing against Jhin and / or Swain or when I play with an Ezrael. If my adc is useless I go roaming after lvl 6 and look out which champ is ahead or needs some roams. But before lvl 6 it’s just awful if the adc has bad positioning don‘t want to push / can’t farm under tower and just keeps dying. And if he keeps dying I always die too when they‘re fed (that’s a thing I have to work on).
Thanks. It just seems very difficult to get these leads without a jungler to match theirs. I see my other lanes as "don't feed and i can carry". I watch pro streams sometimes and obviously there's a huge gap but they end with like 15 kills on each side, my teams are always either stomping with 40 kills or 40 to them. Additionally it's hard to 1v2 but it's probably my fault since my jungler awareness isn't great and I bully laners too far/get pushed in and lose leads
I wouldn't say I'm fixed to the top role but definitely prefer it to others. I enjoy jungling its just that it happens to be very difficult for me to play the champions while clearing quickly and surviving and champions like warwick are just incredibly boring. I think if I one tricked warwick I could reach bronze very easily but that sucks out all the fun of the game.
I really appreciate your tips on warding! I've been struggling a lot with making my wards actually count
Thank you for the advice! Mid is actually my worst role, I play ADC in full parties and Soraka when I'm forced to, otherwise just Top and Jg. I do see the trend of mid laners getting the most impact frags but the way I see it I'm playing league for fun and top is the way I enjoy playing, so im just going to play top haha.
My friend and I were discussing this and I was just curious as to what you thought. Are ap or ad items generally more gold efficient? Trying not to consider champion strength.
Play like you said but Annie is really way too easy as a champion. Play the harder ones you'll get better even faster
I dont flame. When someone flames me i just mute
That's a pretty scary comp. Not gonna lie.

It'd be pretty hard to beat out MF/Thresh bot lane without constant gank pressure... Heavy early game poke + Engage makes them really snowbally. Rek'Sai can still put out a lot of pressure and is a solid pick overall. I still think Sett is overtuned personally... he's just too good at not dying to have that much damage. So the weak link here would be to smash Zoe early or to force ganks botlane to get your team ahead.

Best way to teamfight this comp is to flank them. A head on fight will result in disaster... you'd need an assassin or somebody to flank around the back and pressure the backline while the rest of the team keeps their frontline busy. Thresh will still be there to peel so they'd have to just outplay him. Zoe can only defend herself with her E and MF has no mobility either. If the assassin can win the flank there's nothing Sett and Rek can do about it. You just gotta outplay the Thresh and dodge Zoe E.
Thanks for the response. I see what you mean. So Electrocute doesn't do much and with no AD scaling hybrid is pretty pointless. If you don't mind me asking, what items would you say would be good to keep in mind for a typical build path with an average game? With that I can connect the dots for situational items based on team comps and such. I hadn't considered proto-belt but I can see how it would be useful.
Try to take your lead on others lanes true tp bot or roams. Thats why i play jngl (current Gold), as a jngler i have early Impact on others lanes and can help them. You can only split when your team can defend atleast a turret 4 vs 5. When this isnt possible you need to group up with them. Try to learn a Champ who is strong in teamfights, like Ornn to carry the fights and then you can take Objektives when you have more allies alive then the enemy.And dont tilt in chat, it will make your team run faster down and let you more focus in tilt then carrying the game.
This is a point of contention, so don't be surprised if you get conflicting answers. 

The reason to pick PTA is for early game aggression. The 3 ticks do a little bit of extra burst damage and Kai tends to prefer bursting people down in lane. The other runes are just "Well I'm in the yellow tree... so I guess I'll get Triumph, Bloodline, and Coup cuz they good". It's not really that PTA is all round better necessarily... but it is safer and easier to use. 

To understand the HOB build you gotta note that Kai's big damage booster is her passive. 5 ticks and pop goes the weasel. She also builds AS items like Guinsoo's pretty early. In fact, she'd probably first pick the item (or BORK) if she didn't have mana issues. HOB allows her the ability to exceed the AS limit for a short window and stack her passive (and Guinsoo's) faster. It also allows for you to "double dip" on lifesteal items. Going in the red tree gives you Taste of Blood, free HP during lane trades... while also being able to go Bloodline in the yellow for the same survivability as a PTA build early. So the whole idea of this build is to powerup faster in teamfights (to be more relevant) at the cost of being less likely to snowball early. 

To oversimplify it... PTA = early game + ease of use. HOB = mid game teamfighter + lifesteal + more ults.
I main Yi, but if the other team picks him first I will take Rammus for the counter. If Yi is banned, I’ll play Xin Zhao, Rammus, Karthus, or Warwick depending on the teams comps. Yi is great for safe farming, but not with ganks. Optimally, I only make plays if an objective is no the line, until I get strong enough to 1v5. I can’t rely on teammates to help me if I gank, generally.
I went from voli main to amumu. On voli I could carry the shit out of early and mid but fall off so hard after 30 mins if the game isn’t over. On the other hand I can get stomped early on amumu and still carry late game team fights.
just play noc or yi
I’m not that good but I think you should consider playing mid, you have more control over the game outcome because you get more chances to assist your jungler and have the ability to roam to bot lane to get fed. Also remember that 30% of games are losses no matter what you do, 30% wins no matter what you do (assuming you are not hard smurfing). There is some debate over those numbers but even when I hard inted on Vi jungle for 50+ games (kept getting matched with gold players as a bronze skill jungler, idk why) I got a 35% win rate. 

To answer your question about carrying, you can carry on any champion but it might be best to go for a snowball champion if you are good at the laning phase and a reliable late game carry champion if not. For top lane I’m thinking Fiora for the former and Jax for the latter, although you’ll have to consider your champion pool and the meta to find what works for you. 

Good luck have fun on the rift, remember to keep your cool and focus on self improvement over game result, you got this
it is senna support, it just implies the adc player is playing it and its laning with something other than an adc.
Pick Shen.
you mean lethal tempo? LT scales better very later on. HOB way better early mid game. HOB is by far the most standard.
Blaming everyone else is toxic. It probably effects your ability to play well in a team. I suggest you duo so you're less likely to be negative towards your team mates, and them towards you.
I got from Iron 1 to Gold 4 this month only maining jungle. My mains are shaco/zac/ekko(when ap is needed). I pick between the 3 depending on my team comp. If an assassin is needed I go shaco, if a tank is need I go zac. Don't one trick a champion and pick it for every team comp, play to your team strenght not for solo glory. If you have what your team comp needs you will more likely carry even if you are a tank. Always priorities objectives like dragons and rifts and since you are low elo, look for early ganks. This will give your laners some sort of confidence and not tilt them for never showing up in their lane.
just keep playing till you get better luck
Yeah don't get me wrong, I LOVE a good splitter, I advocate for them by trying to tell my team to just not fight and let the splitter split, doesnt always work though.
Ah, then yeah in that case, teaming up is better. Not much point in getting 2 towers if the enemy is already at my nexus lol.
One advice
When u back from base dont go to your lane, buy speed boots and go mid always.
Then  gank and take vision and go back to botlane 
You dont leave alone the adc a lot  of time ( only 20 sec aprox because you move more fast ).

This is the best advise.
You're underrating the impact of being able to spellshield a laners CC
Hello! As a bot lane main, I think I can help you out. 

So the support's goals in games are, in no specific order: Track jungle, vision control, objective control, macro shot calling. There are probably more minor ones like lane specifics or team fighting specifics, but I won't get into those.

* Jungle Tracking: What impacts my games, personally, is understanding basic jungle role goals. They want to farm and gank. Knowing where the jungler starts and the gank timers is very critical to helping your laners. Just because you are in bot lane doesn't mean you just AFK and click around. You should be proactive from start to finish by warning your top lane of a gank when you see them pushed in with no vision. 

Around the 2 minute mark, I check the map. Who is gankable? Who is the enemy jungler? If I see that my mid is under our tower but they are VERY low and the enemy has an Elise jungle, I will warn them of a potential lvl 2 or lvl 3 dive. Elise has a very strong clear and very strong early gank. If I notice that my top Trynd is pushing in their Nasus with no vision, I'll ping instantly and say "CARE GANK TOP" and ping around the enemy jungle a lot to get their attention. Trynd has his E,s ure, but Nasus wither + whatever jungler... it wont matter. 

This keeps my solo lanes safe, informed, and from tilting. If they listen, great! If not - that's on them. Don't get tilted and dont mind it. Just be aware that the enemy top lane and jungle are now ahead. The next questions to ask are: Does the enemy top have TP? You need to be VERY cautious of TPs from behind or when you're getting a gank because a top laner ahead has strong impact with that. Especially with dragon up. 

* Vision Control: A lot of supports....a nd I mean. Lots. Even in Diamond... have NO idea how to properly use their wards. They have no value in their trinkets or pink wards at all. It's painful when I play adc in lower elo to see our top laner getting ganked and the enemy jungle show/die/recall and my support goes and wards. Like... why? Why are you warding when there is zero threat? It's a complete waste. It's okay to ward, but you have to do it when you'll get value. That ward will probably die before we are even ganked and there is a heavy cooldown if you only have one in your pocket. 

If your lane is VERY gankable and you think you aren't safe and have no vision of the enemy jungle, then ward. It doesn't hurt. But ward FURTHER away from your lane. Don't just throw a ward in a bush really close to you, because for most bot lanes, when the jungle is there it's normally way too late. 

Ward places like... jungle entrances or in the middle of river. I personally ward between dragon pit and the jungle entrance to blue buff, put a pink in my tri ( on either side ) and keep one deep lane ward for TP plays if applicable. You also want to ward according to what type of jungle the enemy has. Is it a Lee, Kayn, or Zac? You need to ward moreso in popular places they engage from like behind walls. 

* Objective control: Your team will probably be all over the place for objectives. Personally, I just tell everyone ahead of time what we need to do. "Let's try to get this dragon." Reset bot, reset mid, get everyone on the same page, ping your top laners TP and say "Hey can you TP if we get into a fight so we win and get dragon?" etc etc. Do this AHEAD of time so that everyone knows the plan and gets on one page. Make sure you use your wards properly and buy a pink for the pit. If the enemy has a Shaco, Lee, Zac, or some type of engage/smite steal type, make sure that your team is properly pulling the dragon out or can zone. If you cannot win a straight 4v4, your team mates are low on health or mana, the dragon isn't free and you have no vision... just stall. It's better to stay alive to defend or fight for an objective then to try to stupidly take it and all int. The enemy gets dragon, lane pressure, and plates. Or even towers at a certain point in the game. Late game, a failed dragon fight leads into a Baron and cracked base. 

* Roaming: It's great you want to roam. In lower elo, you have to be careful about this however. You can't reset with your adc then go to lane, push them out and leave. You roam when:

* Your ADC is dead and the enemy isn't pressuring your tower

* Your ADC has a freeze and there is no threat of dive/ they can safe farm / maintain freeze

* Your ADC and you are pushing to reset

Best tip for roaming is: Reset BEFORE your adc. If you know there is no threat and your ADC and you are pushing to go back to base and buy, just recall ahead of time. Make sure they have the push to crash wave and start. This gives you a good 8-10 second head start. You get your buy, a pink in your pocket, and walk straight mid or even go top. What I do is play Karma/Lulu/Neeko in low elo and rush mobies and use the MS abilities to rush around. I've counter ganked so many lanes, help push, then reset. Run bot. By this time, the wave at bot has only just crashed into tower and I barely  miss any exp and my ADC is safe. 

Don't leave your adc in lane or to a lane where they will be pushed up. Literally ever. Even if it's an ezreal or a lucian. I only leave my adc alone in lane to counter gank mid when I'm duo with another smurf. 

Final point! 

* Mid/late game warding / macro: Early game warding is lane/gank paths. Mid game warding is jungle entrances and objectives. Late game warding is camps/rotation paths. If you have three wards + a pink ( you should either have sweeper unless your jungle does, or trinkets still ) you can ward every camp on one side for your split, to counter a split, or to see where the enemy will be pathing if you're behind. 

Vision is critical to games. It gives YOU the knowledge that YOU need to properly shot call your team. 

I have a low elo adc account and jfc I hate playing on it in low elo because supports never ward and there is zero information on the map and we can't do anything. If you have doubts, just throw your wards out in bushes SAFELY. Dont get caught or die.

ANy toher questions feel free to ask n.n
he's pretty much a mix between a ganking and a dueling champ, he can adapt and play one or the other depending on the match-up. 

There's a lot of champions that can do each one better than him, but he's pretty unique in that he's one of the bests dueling/ganking junglers at scaling. 

Others like him would be Lee Sin, Xin Zhao or Pantheon, and you can see how they can be better at ganking or dueling early on, but Jax outscale all of them pretty hard.
If your looking or play someone top play pantheon he’s really fun to play and easy
Tryndamere is my old main and he’s REALLY fun when you start to get good with him. You’ll have the enemy team flaming their top laner because you’ll spin in and kill their back line with two rapid fire auto attacks a piece. It’s really fun, though hard to play in heavy CC comps cause they’ll just lock you down for your ult. He’s really aggressive though, one of the few tops who takes ignite and you can cheese a lot of first bloods against people who don’t respect your damage early
Common misconception that you want the wave under your turret. You want it close to the middle of the lane, if not just slightly on your side. Being under turret is a poke lane's win condition as it lets them take tower plates and makes skill shots easier to hit due to the narrower lane. Caitlyn can also place traps under turret and it will be really hard to cs. Having it in the middle also allows Alistar to get bush/alcove control and if he can pink a bush and protect it, it makes the lane much more bearable.
What works for me is just playing really aggressive and going from there. At that point I can just look at each individual play and decide whether it was good or not.

If I win, there's no problem. If I lose, I can just cut out the total ints from next game. Hopefully, there are also some plays I made that worked that I can repeat in future games.

If you just spend every game playing as safe as possible, you won't improve very quickly because you have no way to see what you're doing wrong. You just know you should be doing something, and that's not helpful.
For me it’s Sylas and Xerath. They are so dumb op
Unfortunately the 'how' is just practice, the 'why' is because it essentially allows you more control. You could try the semi-locked setting to get started but otherwise it's just practice.  
Another thing you could do is go into practice mode and play around with the camera settings under the Game option.  
You want the mouse to be in the action and not scrolling so try finding a speed where the camera moves just far enough for you (try half a screen to start with) to see what you want to see with minimal time actually scrolling.
ill give him a try thanks! any other suggestions? Im wanting to try a wide variety
My rule is. Olay whoever you think is broken. Everyones playstyles is unique to them, so a character like azir might be broken on fenix cause that's his playstyle, another person can make corkinreally broken. Find rhat character that makes you say, "this is bullshit." Play them. I did that with ahri, I haven't gone back since.
> My understanding is that she's burst and her goal is to delete squishies, however most suggested runes are for Conquerer with Domination as her secondary with a little attack speed. Which I thought was for longer fights and not optimal for burst.

Look at her kit. Conqueror was made for her. Without her ult, she has her Q, two dashes, and W to stack it. She also has really high attack speed without even building any due to her passive. So she stacks it really, really well, and has the survivability to use it in skirmishes and teamfights with her insane mobility and big shield. She also doesn't have great tools for getting in and getting back out, so she's normally forced to take extended fights anyway.

Rageblade isn't so great of an item because Nashors in addition to her passive gives her as much attack speed as she really can use, and like you said her AD scaling is nonexistent. This wastes most of the stats from Rageblade. Similar reasoning for why Gunblade sucks. It's auper expensive, and a lot of the stats end up wasted. You're much better off with a CDR + survivability item like Hourglass or Protobelt in it's place to help you get off your second rotation. And in the case of protobelt it gives you another thing to stack conqueror with, boosts her W shield since it scales off bonus HP, and it's a really cheap power spike w/ a great build path (no ad, every stat is very useful).

Both of these are way cheaper too.
It sounds like you may not be comfortable exerting annie's strengths tho.
Jax? He’s super aggressive and you can hard carry your games with him.  Was a shen main and got bored too and switched to Jax and have been having a lot of success with him. The triforce into black cleaver build is super strong right now, especially against all the meta bruisers rn
My main ( and favourite) role is top but the amount of feeding botlanes is just so horrible and i cant do anything about it because toplane impact is generally bad. Yes i have teleport but when  i go help them. Enemy top just gets free gold from plates and gets better farm and reaches higher level basically making the tp play a big coinflip because if we do not manage to win the fight on bot then we are even in the worse situation.

Yeah, this pretty much summs up Kayn biggest weakness. As a farming jungler, his kit says "don't interact", but his passive forces him to interact. 

Imo a good way to change this would be for him to be able to gain a bit of orbs from farming camps, maybe with what side of the map he's farming on the most deciding which color his orbs are (his blue side give him SA, and red side give him Rhaast), but I don't think Riot want that...
p.s Stick to one role. Stick to a champion pool. You aren't helping your case by jumping around all over.
The most simple answer is: Keep playing. Loss streaks happen and that's just how the balance of MMR is and what Riot does to make things fair. You don't always get the best team mates so if they're inting, just accept those games and move on. They are out of your control. I once went on a 20 game loss streak, so they... are awful, sure, but I did learn a LOT from those games and they helped my climb more than I realized back then. 

Take from each game, win or loss, what you can improve on. Focus on yourself, not your team mates, and learn from their decisions what to and to not do. As long as you play consistently well, you'll climb. Even if it isn't the perfect climb without some hurdles. 

**Those players effect only a few of your games, but they effect ALL of their own.** Keep that in mind.
At 6 it does become unavoidable, but pre 6, given you have a laner that positions only slightly decently, noc will show up and chunk or take a sum, which I would call a successful gank, shyv is considered useless because the r would be all she has, noc has tools more akin to warwick, very big difference
Kayn needs to use his mobility and pick his spots/go after low targets
Def noticing positioning on velkoz is the key diff between a good game and a bad one. 

Not to be a stickler but velkoz combo is better w q e for trades like this. Ty for the contribution
When should i use HoB over PTA with Kai’sa? I’ve been using PTA because it’s just what most guides say to use but i see Hob being used a lot too
Oof. My reply was based on the fact that your team is feeding. Splitting has its place, I know. I was talking about when your team is getting slaughtered 5v4 and tryd is base racing 5 people.
So I've been a Warwick OTP since before rework. I think he really nails dueling and ganking and his clear isn't quite bad either (even though it's slow, it's very safe.) Once he has Tiamat, he does super well in all three areas. His weakness is whatever comes after the "jungle phase" (in the original post's terms). Most of the junglers that he invalidates before 15:00 will contribute more to a 5v5 than he will. It'd be a total exaggeration to say he's like a jungle Pantheon (even though Pantheon jungles now), but it's a similar concept.

EDIT: Also, he's in a pretty good spot right now. So his late-game currently feels a lot better than it usually is
Considering at 6, a ward in river wont help you evade his gank anymore,  and that his only cc requires staying close to an enemy,  and that his only gap closer pre 6 is a movement speed buff same as shyvana, who is considered useless at ganks pre 6 as well,  yeah I'd say he needs 6 to be considered a ganking champion, and a good one at that. Once he has a real gap closer,  all those other tools you listed come together to mean he spends those tools to stay on you and kill you,  rather than get closer to you to chunk your hp.
Prob is the guys that me and the chall are playing with are really far from tier 1
One thing you could do is change it to the value you want, then right click the file and make it “read-only”

Beware as this means any changes to settings you make will be temporary, and default back to the settings when you made it read-only between every game. If you want to make any permanent changes (changes that persist between games) you’ll need to unclick read-only and make the change
Not necessarily. Say I'm 11/1 as tryndamere. My team isn't feeding. Dragon comes up soon, at the 1 minute mark I go top. Since I'm trynd I can push very fast. I get to their turret, they send 2 people after me who I am ahead of. Already that puts my team at an advantage, it's a 4v3 at the dragon pit now. Depending on who they send depends on what I do next. Are they squishy? Not at full health? Dive and kill both. Tanky? Push it into turret but stick around so they don't leave. Now if no one comes at all, and they all show at dragon? Now I've gotten a tower and possibly another. Even if they secure dragon that's a win in my book. Sometimes trading a dragon for multiple turrets is worth it. If I had rift during all that, I could have even gotten it into their inhib. I have won games before where I am the *only* one doing well on my team, only because of trynds great split push potential. He literally does not need his team in a lot of situations. Its the closest to single player you'll get in league
Now, I am just some bronzie, so to a grandmaster you’re probably gonna scoff, but I’d bet on teamwork at that point. If he’s constantly shoved in, maybe top and Jung could do a quick rotate? I don’t play much mid but I am aware of it’s map presence, sounds like easy kills if a noc is permanently shoved in. Then again that implies you’ve got good teammates, but at the same time, grandmasters...

Idk. I’m just spitballing to try an’ problem solve lol
wow -9 downvotes for an educational lol content creator to promote his stuff on a post specifically asking for educational adc content... Yikes!!
Split push so you force them to come to you. Make sure when you split your team is pushing on another lane. With this they will have problem to either send 1 to def yourr lane or fight 4 man push. W
Sure. No one should describe slow pushing like that though in the context of explaining slow pushing/fast pushing and freezing though.
Who should I play in top in Silver - Gold?
None of this matters. The source of all his power as a laner lies in his ability to perma shove with no cost and it also serves as sustain. The champs I play especially cannot poke him out. Corrupting potion + his passive means that I will never have enough mana to force him off the wave. This means that I have to farm under my tower but then im conceding lane priority for the entirety of the lane. If I try to outshove him I will again run out of mana because his passive is resourceless. If I try to freeze then he will just instantly break the freeze by q autoing the wave and when i try to poke him he will absorb half my damage with his spellshield and then sustain the rest back with potions and passive. I really don't think this champion has any counterplay.
on glacial veigar ingenious hunter is better choice 95% of time
Nope. There's only 1 session. The time was always available in the Clash tab, but I almost missed the change in time as well; its not super obvious.
Thats the point. You cant set a freeze anymore with tiamat.
I'd suggest Warwick, as he's very basic (he can clear a camp by just standing there). Check Mobafire for a guide on how to play him (google search "warwick guide").

A very easy and good route is Red>Gromp>Blue or Blue>Gromp>Red. Always start on the bottom side of the map and get a leash from your adc and support. Don't smite your first buff, just smite the gromp when it's about half health. DO NOT BUY POTIONS ON WARWICK EVER. Your starting items are Hunter's Machete and Bead of Rejuvenation, no exceptions. Don't try to clear Raptors or Krugs without Tiamat unless you've tried it in practice tool.

As for how to play jungle in general, your goal is to first identify which lanes are going to win (this is why jungling is hard, you have to have matchup knowledge for every lane). Then, you focus ganking those lanes and putting them ahead so they can win easier. 

Some basic strategies and Warwick tips:

Do your route, then look to one of the two lanes that you're closest to (mid and either top or bot lane) and see which laners are closer to your tower. Gank the one that's closer because you can flank easier. If neither is very close, go into the enemy jungle and walk right up to their buff and steal it (very easy since your route is very fast). If the enemy jungler is right there, even better! Kill them and then take their buff.

Warwick can solo drake at level 4. Don't use the second activation of your E on drake.

(general jungle strat) gank bot and then when the botlaner is dead, take drake.

Warwick can solo Rift Herald at any point.

(general strat) Gank top or mid and then take rift herald after the gank.

(general strat) If you see the enemy jungler on the opposite side of the map and can't get there to help, gank the side you're currently on or take his jungle camps.

Good luck!
he's broken tbh.

Good clear at level 1 which he can solo raptors and not worry about losing HP due to lifesteal (runes included) and corrupting pot. Always has lane prio and even at pre 6.
Who did you play in jungle? As a nunu main i feel the gank and objective pressure is helpful, but he’s incredibly team reliant. Did you play a carry jg like yi or khazix???
Something I’m surprised nobody else has said is to play the free rotation in normals. It’s a nice break from LP focus and every time I switched jungle mains it is because I played a free rotation champion that I liked.
I actually did really well in lane vs Liss and Vlad, ended laning phase like 3/0 both lanes, but I just get frustrated sometimes cos I couldnt cs much and it’s just so annoying. I build Tri into black cleaver then PD, lots of CD and tankiness too. You think thats good? I’ve tried many builds on my “smurf,” this was the best so far.
I would say base it around the playstyle you want. I mainly play top as tryn or nasus. Tryn is a fun bruiser, but can get kited, so then I'll play nasus into those because I can just let wave push to me and just farm. Early kills are not the focus as nasus, you just want to scale your q to have a mid to late game impact. 

In the jg, I probably main kayn, because you can choose whether you want red or blue after seeing the enemy teams picks, but I also really enjoy olaf, or trundle. Which are all bruisers or tanks depending on the build. With the exception of blue kayn, which I will ONLY choose if theres 3 to 4 super squishy picks on the other team, with not a lot of cc or disengage. But if you find that game. Blue kayn is so much fun, after full jg item, duskblade and mobis you can just about 1 v 3+, you just q auto w in, use your r to wait out your cd resets. And then q w again. 

I guess I'm just trying to say, what playstyle do you want, do you want a high sustain champ, assassin, bruiser, and once you decide that, pick the champ you want to focus on.
You don’t choose the champion. The champion chooses you. You’ll know when the time is right.
Thanks for the info really appreciate it I’ll take these into consideration next time I play :)
Mhm true
I just started using him. I used to main Lee Sin but Jungle is a pain in the ass in low elo so I just stopped playing him :/
Too often I see Garens in low elo fall behind against something like a mage and feed a bunch of kills and they don’t change their itemization at all.  They feed a handful of kills and end up something like 1/5 and STILL trying to finish tri and PD.  They build as if they’re still the carry on the team and a legitimate damage threat when they’re window is closed.  So of course they run in way behind with offensive itemization and get clapped right away.  They can’t stop and tell themselves ‘I’m not killing anything this game, I’m too far behind, I need to tank up and depend on my team.’  

I don’t know if you’re doing this, but I see this a LOT especially with Garen.
Quinn can be a good one, man. Nice tip. Teemo I feel like it can be too volatile.

I used to play a lot of jayce back in the day, so I personally like playing him a lot, but it feels a lot weaker. 

I like playing Kayle, but every time I went ranked it seems like the junglers dont leave me alone, so I seldomly get to the point where I am a late game supercarry. 

Idk, it feels like here in Brazil the picks are very different from the ones I see streamers play in US or EU.
> .I try mage supports to help do more damage but I get an 0/7 laner somewhere else and I feel useless

You have to hard win your own lane. There's some games that are unwinnable (say everyone on your team except you gets absolutely smashed), but there's also some that you can't lose no matter what. What matters is your performance in the 3rd type of games, which are close enough that the determining factor is your own performance. 

> I try playmakers but feel without damage and when we’re behind it’s a done game.

A Thresh constantly creating picks can claw his team back into the game. A Rakan constantly getting great engages can claw his team back into the game.

> Who would be the best to climb with?

At those ranks I think mage supports are the best option. Often people misuse their champions and put out laughably low damage numbers, so it's up to you to pick up the slack. Plus, there's no guarantee your ADC won't suicide even if you give him a lead, so it's nice to have an extra source of damage.

> Is support good to climb with in low Elo

Yes and no. It's a position that relies a lot on your team, but there's also a lack of support mains in low elo which puts you at an edge in nearly every match. If you're able to abuse that, you should win pretty much every lane. As a support, you also have more impact early on than pretty much anyone except the jungler.
Does nocturne who stands there and auto attacks with his spellshield, cc, and bonus ms really need 6 to do a successful gank?
Try Lissandra, you can try to bait out his shield with Q then W to peel for yourself. I'm not sure if she can outpush Nocturne but you should be able to poke him out easily pre-6, seeing as there is pretty much no way he should be able to get on top of you. Also be careful with Rumble is solo queue. Since you say you are 100LP GM you should know this, but Rumble pretty much autopushes lane if you turn your brain off and junglers at that elo know to abuse you.
Yea I hate this especially if Im like a yi or something its like bruh what do you want me to do just q in there get snared by lux and die while you guys circle jerk? I know like dont make in painfully obvious a gank is coming but like move up into attack position so you can initiate the 2v2 just before I enter the fight, same thing applies if I play a roaming mid like Talon.

Damn, I really havent played her in a while.
Knight's Vow is not a good rush option imo. At least not over Zeke's, Redemption and Stoneplate. The only time I rush Knight's Vow is if I want to get a Locket 2nd item as the bonus HP from the Knight's Vow will add onto Locket's shield (with a fully completed quest, that's 110 HP added onto the base shield for a total of extra 550 hp if you shield your entire team).

Between those three, Zeke's is my go-to because of the great build path and useful stats it gives for cheap. However, if my ADC can't properly utilize the passive or if I need more tankiness, Stoneplate is my go-to. Redemption can also be a useful rush.

> then i get dissuaded from building a locket further in the game if i have zekes.

Not sure why. Locket is really good on tank supports especially.

> get sunfirecape leona asap.

Never. Sunfire on supports is a noob trap.
Maybe...quicksilver sash? Cleanse? His ult counts as cc so you can purify the near sighted thing, or his fear
> So I‘m asking for some advice playing as Supp against Swain Supp

Don't get hit by Swain E. That's literally it. If he doesn't land that ability, he's completely useless and only has a W that anyone with hands can dodge and a Q that sits on a massive cooldown early game. His E gives you ample time to dodge it.

> They often focus my adc (who often won‘t dodge anything) and then I don‘t know how to help him. 

If the enemy support engages on your ADC, you engage on theirs. Whether you win that 2v2 or not depends on what the ADC and support matchup is, though. If your ADC consistently gets caught, you're better off roaming and trying to snowball another part of the map.

If you're Morgana, spellshield at least the pull portion. Could try going extra points in E early if your ADC is getting consistently caught. Nami and Leona should win that 2v2 assuming the ADC on your team isn't something massively weak early game. With Janna, a well timed shield might prevent most of the damage.
Yeah that happens. What I usually do is if dragon is showing up soon, like around a minute, I go top. With that much time remaining, and being tryndamere I push really quickly it usually gets at least one person to come for me. If I'm fed, 2 or 3. Allows us to get dragon. I only do this IF my team is stable. If I think they can't win a 4v4 at the least, like if I'm the only one doing well on my team, I'll usually follow them. Trynd unfortunately isn't the best team fighter, though that largely depends on the match up
You pick a champ you like it's not complicated
I say this a lot but you should give poppy jg a try. You can go full tank, bruiser, or assassin. You can build based on comp needs, or based on how fed you are. I go full tank poppy jg and love it so much, she has weaknesses in lane that can't be taken advantage of when she's jungling. Pretty decent damage, great cc and catch potential, and great ganks considering everyone has dashes nowadays. Super fun, healthy clear 10/10

And how does Kayn work?

Kayns clear is very very good and he got good mobility but he is really bad at dueling and he does not offer much at ganking (low damage and only CC is a slow); so you usually want to farm. And if you get counterganked you will die most of the time. 

However, you need to gank to get form otherwise you will be useless. The more you delay your form the longer your team will be 4.5 champs vs 5

So you basically play a farming jungler that HAS to gank but is pretty shit at it. Especially when your lanes are losing ganking gets almost impossible and this really delays your form. And then you can‘t contest one single objective because you’re not even a full champ without form meanwhile your team calls jgl diff cuz they died to 5 ekko/amumu/evelynn (whatever jgl has good gank setup) ganks.
He means slow push towards you
It's one of the only sources of magic pen which is supposed to be *really* good on Azir. Usually I won't even build morellos until literally last item. 

That said, if they're building a lot of mr or are very tanky, flat magic pen isn't as valuable iirc, in which case Liandries is a good choice. Liandries may be a good choice either way, but I'm not familiar with it yet.
Now that Darius can JG, you can jungle and top lane him. He's able to take over a game and pretty fun. Predators in the JG and a lane bully top.
There's a program called WeGame that chinese players use, and it shows exact monster and objective health. I'm not totally sure how you'd go about using it but it shouldn't be that hard, considering it's developed by Tencent and league is owned by them.

I'd be very cautious about using anything else, since riot is very anal about 3rd party programs. I've heard a story of someone getting banned for using a program that displayed the scoreboard timers.
Swain Jhin is probably on par with Draven Janna levels of BS. My duo and I main that combination because it's just a free lane if either enemy is bad.

The only time we have trouble is against ranged peel supports, primarily Morgana. Her Black Shield negates both Swain and Jhin's root in a single cast and she can counter engage with her binding once they both miss.

Zyra is also a super annoying lane for this duo because she can poke them down from range and counter engage. Her ult can be used to completely negate an engage and turn it around, and its on a very short cool down.

Jhin Swain is really strong when they have lane control. If you deny them that, they become very hard to play because they are both immobile.

Also, don't get cocky and stay around with less than 400 health. Jhin loves to flash+4th shot+Q, or ult as you are running away. 

If your laner is low under tower spam ping them to recall, because Jhin doesn't give a shit about tower aggro and he will flash for it. Even if you manage to root him under tower and kill him he will gladly take that trade as he only needs 1 kill to get BF sword on his first back and take over the lane.
LOVE THIS!!! I've been trying to get better at jungling and this breaks down things really well. Most of my experience is in the jungle and I've had somewhat of an idea of how this works, but not a clear understanding. This was well written and this knowledge is very helpful. Thank you so much for taking the time to write this up.
Not to mention if either of them get poked down even a third of their health then they will most likely die in the fight unless Ali gets a godly engage.
I would recommend a game that was not stomp in neither players direction.

 I would recommend a game that was quite close, and had you made better decisionmaking and plays then you could have won the game.
>\&amp;amp;gt;\&amp;amp;gt; slow  push; arguably the best thing a losing lane can do. Only last hit so  the wave naturally pushes to you

This is wrong. Slow pushing is killing the caster minions and last hitting the melee minions to build a big wave pushing towards the enemy. 

I didn't bother reading the rest.
Im currently gold and wanting to atleast hit plat this year but am having a mid-league crisis. I have been playing top most of the time but am getting bored of just playing boring champs like shen to lose lane win game. I want to git gud but im not sure what role or champion to play, I like really aggressive champions, things like yasuo, but yasuo gets too many bad matchups. What/who are your suggestions to play to get out of gold?
In order to find a new main. I'd choose someone who has quite a high skillcap so that even after hundreds of games you still feel like you have something to improve on that champion. Preferably this champion stays relevant through several different metas. This main champion of yours will be your go to champion when blindpicking or when first pick.

&#x200B;

In the jungle, the most obvious example of this would be Lee Sin or Elise.

&#x200B;

I would follow this up by having a back up whenever this champion is picked of banned. Oftentimes, this back up would be a champion who works well as a counter to your main in some way. Finally you can have a pick that fills a different role than that of your main. So essentially you will end up with 3 champions in your pool. Your main go to champion, your counter back up, and your role filling back up. Your back up champions are champions you can go to and select either when your main is pick or banned or when you are on the last picks to select to either counter the enemy or complement your team.

&#x200B;

As an example I am a top lane main, and my main is Irelia. I really love Irelia and I never feel like i have a perfect game on her so I want to keep improving with her, and even though she is not the best champion right now in toplane, she is still very strong in the hands of a seasoned Irelia player. I pick Irelia whenever I am first pick or blindpicking in one of the first 2 positions.

My counter champion is Fiora since she does well vs Irelia. She is also fun to play and I got a good amount of experience on her. But since when I play Fiora I basically just play a very splitpush style, I only use her very situationally as a counter to Irelia or in a game where I know I'll want to splitpush based on teamcomps. Therefore I never blindpick her (even though she is S tier in this meta).

My final back up pick is Poppy. I chose Poppy to round out my composition. Because Poppy fills a completely different role than Irelia and Fiora. Poppy is a tank and excels in teamfights and I still find her fun to play. Poppy is also a good counter to both Fiora and Irelia in lane in case those champs are picked. Both Fiora and Irelia really benefit from having a primary engager on the team, so if the team does not have one of these, then I am more likely to pick Poppy. So if I am one of the last picks and I feel like my own team could use a tank I pick Poppy.

&#x200B;

Hope this helped :)
>I'd flash behind him,

Good luck getting within flash range.

The reason why it's such an ass match-up is that the xer and the Cait both stay 2 miles away while poking. You flash or engage, they stun you, Cait roots with a thrown trap, and you die like a fool.

The only way you pull off anything is if either the Cait or the Xerath comes close enough, which they only will if they're trash and don't realize they turbo-counter you simply by being far away.

If you flash+headbutt to close range, unless you're building damage they'll just kill you before your adc can follow up.
Maybe you should reduce your champion pool. Focus on 2-3 champs (I play a mage / a tank / a healer) and if you‘re comfortable with them focus on your macro. I haven’t played league for a longer time and when I got back I had an awful start. I played a lot of champs and my macro was awful. I started watching some streams and guides (I like Lohpallys Youtube account) and remembered what I did better in the past. Since then everything works way better. 

I don‘t know what you know about your position and what not but vision is key. After your support item is „upgraded“ and you have wards don‘t walk straight back to lane. If your adc was back too just walk to mid lane and place „deep wards“ but first have a look at the map where the enemy’s are (and make sure your adc isn’t in trouble) and don‘t go to deep. Maybe you can also do a roam mid or just go back to your lane. If you have ult ready and your lane is loosing but the mid laner has kills try to focus on him and help him snowballing. Also always focus on the carry of your team while team fighting and that is not always your adc. Also don’t be too passive neither too aggressive at lane and try to stand a bit further than your adc (a lot of people always have a pretty bad this positioning 10 miles behind their adc).
Prepare to be flamed in low elo for attacking tanks instead of "focusing the carry." 

If the carry walks into your auto attack range, sure you can hit them. But anybody that thinks an adc should be diving with them is an idiot and should be muted.
Depends on the game, but AS slows, cdr, utility
Thanks for the reply.

I have heard of this build path a couple of times already. I am mostly interested in the Oblivion Orb - its a item used to get Morellos but if you don't want it, I kinda don't see the point of the item.

Could you enlighten me a bit?

I mean to me personally, paying 1.6k Gold for 20AP, 200HP and 15Pen seems kinda expensive, especially if you don't want to finish Morellos.
To be clear, I go Conqueror. 

I always go Nashor's, boots, oblivion orb first.

Then I complete Morellos if I'm into a team with a lot of healing, if I'm not doing great I'll go defensive with Zhonyas or Banshees, and if I'm super fed I'll go rabadons.
Thank you a ton! This is great info! I started to run some games last night and just felt like I had zero impact but that’s most likely because I had zero idea what I was doing.
ur AA outranges most champs so you can just poke adc or even poke supp. Poke supp whenever you can if they are about to use relic shield or you are in position to auto supp without being aa'ed by adc. Champs like cait cant spam q and they are quite easily avoidable.
As far as I know but guides for a champ will have these things in them, but maybe not laud out so specifically.  You also could just ask this subreddit
Aren't they both really good at farming and bad at gank and dueling pre 6. Then you just farm and avoid jungler with high pressure.
I play in the jungle so I don't die a lot. The problem is when my teammates take useless fights in the jungle and push as 4 without minions. Pings don't always stop them.
How do u do this every time I change it as soon as I go into game it resets back to default value?
I think it's in the interface if I'm not mistaken
Just learn to follow up when your mid or jungler pings they are coming. The fact that they ping OMW doesn't mean that they have to initiate the fight, it means that you have to lure the enemies into a 2v2 which will become a 2v3 or a 2v4 in an instant when your allies arrive... As a TF main I get frustrated that absolutely no one in Gold/Plat know this, let alone Iron/Bronze/Silver... I type "I'm coming bot", ping omw 2-3 times, ult, port in and my adc+supp are still at their tower jerking each other off...
Um idk what to tell you honestly other than learn how your champions interact with other champions. Like Garen is pretty brain dead mechanically, is tanky and does a lot of damage. Garen really tests how well you the know the game of league of legends as whole. When in lane it should be pretty obvious on what trades you will win and when you should trade and when you shouldnt. Garen has no mechanics to worry about or even resources, its i know my q and spin does x damage and they have x health, they do this much damage while silenced so I should trade now and retreat with the remainder of my e.
I’m not the guy that said panth, but it’s not a bad idea to have a flex pick as a main. Then it doesn’t matter as much of you are auto filled.
I am mostly trying to learn as much about the role as I can so I can overall become better player.

However I dont feel like I am accomplishing that with annie because I get outroamed by more mobile champions or outpushed or just straight up kill me if they hit one ability. So its like most of my time I am trying to compensate for annie weaknesses rather than getting better knowledge of the role.
Don’t play Garen all the time? He’s easily countered and when you start getting towards gold people take into account counters a bit more
Any tips against a comp like Sett, Rek'Sai, Zoe, MF, Thresh.. 

How do you play against something like that, they have a pretty good frontline with sett thresh and rek. and it seems like MF just waits for cc from her team to ult and zoe is in sniper range
Play an easier champion. Mordekaiser will get you out of Iron alone.
lol what
This is what I used to do using your logic as well, but what's probably happening is a big overestimation of the value of Seraph's mana-AP conversion. 

Ludens gives 600 mana. At Seraphs completion, 3% of max mana becomes AP. 3% of 600 = 18 AP. Not very much. After I realized this, I ditched the build.

Trust the builds you see on ProBuilds. I have never seen any professional mage player build both these items. The closest I've seen is Dopa build Ludens and then Tear of the Goddess, but he did not complete it into Archangel's Staff. This seems to suggest that the potential 1000 mana for 850 gold can be worth it, but because the high high high majority of the time we see only Ludens OR only Archangel's (mutually exclusive), we just need to manage our mana better. Even though it's really hard with Ludens.
your brain
yes please it would be so helpful... \^\^
I’m pretty sure her ult charges tear and you need to be getting takedowns to get the mana from Presence of Mind. 

Anivia does have a pretty strong level 1-2 but after that she is a very weak champion because her mana costs are so high.  

Also in midlane after 6 you can literally just shove the wave whenever you want so you don’t have to be worried about getting zoned.
I'm sorry to mention this but this is a stupid think to ask. You can't ask for help on this. You don't choose champion to be your main, you see how a champion feels, if you like it you will go for it naturally. It grows on you organically and cannot be forced.
Try and pressure top. If your bot loses the game because they got ganked on repeat is it really their fault? Yea probably but what could you have done in that situation? Pressure the map.

Force yourself to be a priority for the enemy team. 

What I see often is that top/mid are focused before dragon spawns and then once dragon spawns the junglers are bot lane 24/7.

Stay safe before the dragon spawns but after that try to apply so much pressure to the top/mid that their jungler has to answer.

I play ADC and a lot of the times its just 2v3 down here. My jungler won't ever help me and after 5 minutes the enemy jungler ganks 3 or 4 times in a row.

If I survive great, but realistically they are going to make something work eventually.

Use this to your advantage and try to make the enemy jungler feel like they have to gank you. If the enemy jungler doesn't ever visit your lane then that frees them up to just hard camp the ADC
I think you will be Tier 1 just because of the Challenger midlane alone.

Get rid of the Challenger if you want to drop to tier 2. You may even drop to tier 3 if you replace them with a silver/gold player. 

However, I wouldn't worry too much about rank imbalances in Clash. There is some finer matchmaking that goes on during lock-in phase and after Tier creation, so that the system (for instance) tries NOT to match a Tier 1 full Diamond team against a Tier 1 full Challenger team. 

If you do end up being Tier 1 and you think your 4 Gold/Plat players are not good enough to be in Tier 1, don't worry. If you lock in right as lock in phase starts, there should be enough 'bad' Tier 1 teams for you to get matched with who should also have plenty of Golds and Plats, or maybe even as low as Silvers and Bronzies.
One or two trick a champion and know every matchup inside and out. You need every advantage you can get on your opponent and you don’t want to be missing solo kills. The other thing is that you need to improve your wave management. You think you know wave management but you really don’t. Sometimes I play custom 5v5 games with higher elo toplaners and I was playing mechanically pretty well, but I was getting zoned off CS and stuff because my wave was in a shitty spot and I was forced to chose between catching side waves and joining fights later on in the game.
When to use BD first vs Using corrupting potion first? I'm assuming the more health you're missing, it would be better to use BD first since it restores % missing mana and HP, no?
Can you categorize Jax? I know he’s a late game duelist, but how else would you describe him?
As a bot support at least, she can throw out a ton of damage with her burst combo.

Maybe playing passive early can work mid, but I’d be worried about getting zoned. I guess she has to trade more there though, instead of more decisive fights.

Presence of Mind seems to basically solve her post-lane phase Anna issues on its own.

And it seems like she’d be slow to charge a tear.
Go Bloodrazor Guinsoo then Death’s Dance if the enemy has a lot of physical damage otherwise go Witt’s End if the enemy has a lot of magic damage. Then buy Death’s Dance if you haven’t already. The passive is really good for Master Yi.
Doesn’t help when your support runs into every turret and gets hit by every rocket and grenade either. I swear it’s like dodging doesn’t exist to them.
Most adcs instantly lose their strength when they get jumped on, but heimerdinger is strongest when people are trying to get onto him
I feel like he has the best defensive setup/engage punish of any character who can play as the farming champ bot
Haha I mean I hate heimer bot.
id recommend you to play champions that can disengage. If you have splitpusher the enemy has to either engage on you four or collapse on the splitpusher meaning your team can get other objectives. Picking a chanp that can disengage is important thats why Sup are really broken. They can decide games simply by what theyre picking
I also have had success with panth mid lethality rush
Silver players don’t know how to play against these, especially heimerdinger. You win 2v3s easily, just immediately focus the jungler/support who runs/dashes onto you
I'm kind of curious about this too. Especially with junglers that need 6 to effectively gank (nocturne, very notably Evelynn, etc.).
Anivia is not an early game champion. You build tear into archangels later so that you have the mana to use your ult to stall by clearing waves or in late game sieges and teamfights. If you build lost chapter first, you really end up needing blue buff or your going to have to back every other wave.
Your joking right? cheese lanes the way to go?
First of all, pushing in your lane and roaming is fine as long as you are doing it at the right times. That playstyle is very viable and that's what most roaming midlaners do. I would stick with annie and keep working on your mid fundementals. She is probably the most straight forward champion you can use to learn laning in mid lane. If you need a break from annie, try out orianna. She is my current second pick(when vlad is banned) and she can also teach you the importance of wave manipulation and taking good trades.
Play a decent range mage bot like Syndra or Heimerdinger. Watch the wins roll in.
You know Xerath has a stun, right?
Wait doesn't Karthus "gank" pretty well with his R? Otherwise, damn good guide
in 10.6?
Pick someone you like aesthetically. Then look at their kit and ask if you still like them.
If someone is level 400, and in Iron elo, they suck. Don't ever look at levels as a measure of skill. Or masteries. This just unnecessarily tilts you and causes anxiety.
Don't play GP in low elo. GP is only good if you're good. His barrel tricks are wasted on an Iron player (but predictable in higher elo). 

Play someone like Ashe, she's busted right now. 

Or Wukong, he's even more busted.
Golden Rule.
Its mainly a mental thing, if you die 5 times in lane u most of the are tilted beyond redemption and so it has a higher value than just gold etc. The same is true for the rest of your team, if you are even and the rest have been playing bad chances are everyone flames and see no chance at winning
you can always see exact buff, dragon, herald and baron health its to help players smite these important objectives and this cant be changed. You cant show minion health numbers and it's kind of pointless if you could, if your fighting your own minions for the cs it's a timing issue not a numbers issue, you'll just have to practice last hitting when the health bar is low enough and you'll have to provide a screenshot of your last issue cause that sounds like a problem on your end.
Great post, I'm pretty fresh to the game and I know I've seen other Junglers play more methodically like in your guide but I didn't realize what they were doing and what allowed them to do so. Thanks!
Hey guys, I currently need some help on a champion to climb on SoloQ.

I peaked in Solo at D5 (or D4 I don't remember) on S7. since then I've been high plat and not really looking to climb. This season I got D4 in Flex (I know, Flex is somewhat of a joke, I have an overall 52%WR but I do a lot of troll picks and champion testing on flex) mostly playing Qiyana (68% WR on her). I played my qualifier matches and not much else in Soloq and I'm currently G1, my MMR seems to be quite high since I'm getting 25-26lp per win. I mostly want to diversify my picks because I'm not an OTP and playing just one champion is a bit boring for me, even though I love QiQi.

I've always enjoyed playing top lane, and I mained old Irelia (still love her, but not sure I want to spend the time it takes to make that dumpster fire of a champion work). Top is too weird and snowbally for me atm though. I enjoy playing agressive and roaming BUT I think maybe it's time for me to go back to safe mages. I also like jungle and ADC, so you guys can see I'm totally lost here.

Here's my [op.gg](https://op.gg) for reference [https://br.op.gg/summoner/userName=gantes](https://br.op.gg/summoner/userName=gantes)

My questions:

1. how hard it is right now  execute AP Shyvana in jungle? My KDA is always absurd on her but my winrate is average, it seems like people can't play around having a scaling jungler on the team
2. how hard are ADC mechanics for high elo? I like Kai'sa and Xayah mostly, but I'm coinflippy af as ADC and I'm too agressive early for these champions I think
3. what champions would you say my Qiyana skillset could translate to?
4. how strong are defensive control mages (like Zilean, Ori) right now?
5. is it even worth it learning top lane again?

Sorry for the big ol wall of text and thanks in advance <3

EDIT: back on my glory days in S7 I climbed playing Sejuani for whatever reason, even though it's a completely different playstyle from what I have now
This is only my second season playing ranked, and last season I was silver 1. And this season I’m stuck at silver 4. I have 230+ games this season (I can’t work or go out do to corona) and I’m very hard stuck in silver.
Yeah I used to search for Smurf guides when I mained ADC. The only one I could find was someone Smurfing to Plat and getting hard stuck even though their main was high Diamond. Everyone else was a duo. 

Nearly every Challenger player duos when ranking accounts. I'm not saying they wouldn't get to Challenger Solo, but it would be a long, long, long grind where they need to play the game to perfection every game. 

I was Silver for 3 seasons and when I switched to Jungle I got Gold for the first time literally 2 months later.
For sure there are disadvantages to it. But honestly after you watch that video you won’t want to “poke the fish”
Try xin or khazix, all in kill junglers are fun
Panth can't really carry. That's why I dropped him. Especially in lower ELOs, where people don't know how to close out a game.
Also Tarzaned he has a. Lot of content.
Play nunu jungle or tryn top. Learn the game. Gave this advice to my noob buddies and they made it to gold already. 

r/proudparent
If you try to get 10cs/min in a solo lane you'll just die because the other laner can get free trades on you and you'll be csing in their face the entire time
Last season I peaked at Platinum 2 with enchanter supports, mainly Nami, Soraka, Yuumi, etc - this season I'm finding it MUCH easier to climb with tank or bruiser junglers like Rek'sai, Wukong, Zac, and Warwick. I'd like to expand my champion pool with similar junglers - namely Zac and Wukong as I win the most games on these two.

I like to engage for my team and set up kills, or single out the enemy carry to assassinate. I'm not a fan of most assassin playstyles though, hence why I prefer champions like Rek'sai or Wukong over say, Kha'zix or Rengar. Anyone that's also good in high Silver/low Gold (current rank, sadly) would be great.

I've played the game long enough (I think about 8-9 years) that I know most of the champion kits off the top of my head - so I'm not too concerned about complexity of kits or skill ceiling.
I usually ask the phone number of the one who trash talked me and not the one who slain me
well, league has been a saltfest bitching about riot pumping out skins for a long time now.  It's a bitch to learn but when you're snowballing it can be really fun...but soloq diminishes that.  Get a duo, especially if you want to be an ADC or support, and spend the first month dedicating yourself to being really good at killing the magic red midgets that give you gold...unless you're support.  I would also avoid jungling as a new player.
only taking their main traits into account : 

Nunu and Olaf are duelists 

Sej, Taliyah and Xin are ganking junglers 

Kindred is a farming jungler
sorry, i meant kindred, silly me :p
Diamond Eve main here. Since you’ve been playing since season 5, I’m assuming you already know the ins and outs of the champs you play the most. If not, you need to spam games with your mains. My advice may be different than some since I essentially one-tricked my way up the ladder, but general jg pathing/strats still apply.

1. Know the meta. Even if you only spam one champ, your jg pathing and priorities change significantly. For instance, most of last season I’d farm until 6 then take over mid game, but so far this season I’m ganking every lane level 2,3,4 etc. when ever I get the chance. This can change virtually every patch based on jg exp buffs/nerfs, change in drag/rift prio, etc. So know what is strong, and play towards that.

2. Know how to gank effectively. A failed gank can be catastrophic. Not only do you reveal your location, but you can end up burning sums aggressively for nothing, expose other lanes based on wave position, or even dying to the opposing laners you’re trying to gank. I recommend watching guides on laning and wave manipulation to better understand when to gank. For instance (simple example), if you see a wave frozen towards their tower with even minions on both teams, you know that the wave will naturally slow push back towards your tower where your team can set up a freeze. Before backing, the opposing laners will usually want to bounce the wave off the turret, so you should know you can gank in roughly the next 30-60 seconds if your team doesn’t hard push. If they hard push the wave (common with early game AD’s, Sivir, and ranged supports) you can still probably gank in that time frame since the wave isn’t stacking. This is more reliable in plat+ than in silver/gold since laners don’t really understand wave manipulation in low elo.

3. Know how to snowball a lead. In short, use advantages that you’ve created. If you’re strong, gank more. If a lane is strong or you put their lane opponents behind, snowball that until you get turret. Never gank a losing lane (especially against a champ that can easily 1v2 like Darius or Illaoi).

4. Go into every game knowing your win condition. When I first started getting serious about climbing (out of Silver to Diamond), I would say my win condition out loud to make sure I understood what objectives to play towards. If we are playing a hyperscaling ADC bot against a Lucian or Draven, I probably don’t want to heavily prioritize the first two drags since it’s a greater chance that they kill all of us when we contest. If you’re playing a weak early jg such as Zac against someone stronger like a Lee Sin or Graves, play safe, track them well, and ward for your lanes if possible because you cannot contest early ganks as easily. If you have a scaling comp, play for late. If you have an early game comp, snowball and make plays. That’s enough examples, but you get the idea. Use your brain and play towards a WC. Don’t get discouraged early if things aren’t going your way, trust the game plan.

5. I cannot give good advice on streamers, but I watch a lot of LCS (every game since S5... I have no life). Mostly what watching LCS helps me with is the first eight minutes of jungle pathing in the current meta. Pro play is an entirely different game from solo queue, but you can learn a lot as a jungle by recognizing warding/sweeping patterns, early pathing based on team comp/matchups, etc. in the laning phase, especially the first eight minutes. Watching YouTube guides can be very helpful as well (jungling and laning - the more you understand the game as a whole, the better you will be). Most guides I’ve seen refer to early game, since strategizing for the mid/late game is so situational.

Overall, after the laning phase, play smart and towards your WC. Always have 2 control wards in inventory, and ward objectives preemptively while controlling side lanes. When climbing out of lower elo, there is a lot of unnecessary fighting. If you have superior vision and stay with the team, you are more likely to win the team fights even if it seems like the wrong thing to do in a macro sense. This may seem odd, but if you have a bronze Yasuo or Riven on your team that thinks he or she can 1v5, just grouping and fighting could be the best option. Once you hit upper gold/plat, that usually starts subsiding a bit.

I hope this helps. If anyone disagrees with any of my advice please comment so we can discuss publicly and others can weigh in. I’m always looking for means to improve. Good luck climbing, and let me know if you have any other jungle related questions.
Why eve? I understand someone like lee would want it but why evelynn?
ACKTCHUALLY it's called "Scryer's Bloom."  Failing to know key knowledge like this is the reason you're not challenger. You need to spend at least six hours every day memorizing the wiki and watching Necrit's lore videos.
It looks like you are lagging or experiencing ping spikes. Make sure your internet connection is stable.
The default for this build is Conq, but I always take Conq on Draven, even though he has no keystone. 

Another would be Hail of Blades with PoM secondary.
She can, I use both Presence of Mind and Tear just to make sure I never run out of mana.

This is the bit of information I was missing. I was under the impression that most ADC smurfs have the ability to just throw themselves in any game and carry it. Duo's always seem problematic at my elo because I think there are very few good supports here.
The problem with the play style you describe of pushing and roaming on talon, kat, ekko, is that you aren't really playing the lane so much as avoiding it. This is fine. You can climb through diamond with this 1D playstyle, and if you enjoy it, that's all the better. You won't however be able to play mages or any other traditional champions down the line if you decide to try. The fact that you're struggling after 50 games with Annie suggests that you don't know how to actually lane. Laning is deep and complex. Small advantages are built up through thoughtful trades and wave manipulation. It's a difficult skill set to learn, so if your goal is to play anything besides roaming assassins down the line, it's best to bite the bullet now and learn how to do it.

I may be completely wrong in my assessment, as I've never even seen you play the game. If you really do think Annie is the problem, try picking up Orianna to practice mid lane instead. The same coaches who recommend Annie to low elos suggest that Ori is the next step for high plat/low diamond players. She has a bit more complexity to her kit, but her laning is safer and even abusive in some matchups, and her scaling is quite strong.
Old Death's Dance was better for ranged champions.

Right now, I don't really see the reason to go Death's Dance over something like Bloodthirster.
Half of the reason the ocean is salty is because Nautilus is collecting it from me.  As a pretty low-elo adc, I'm still working on dodging his q, but the big thing for me is that he can just walk up and it feels like there's nothing I can do.  When the wave is near my tower, he just walks around it and I need to back off and focus on dodging or die because failing means I don't get to move for the next hour.  I've considered buying lethality, but I don't think he really starts armor stacking until later in the game, and many of my favorite champs are crit adcs. So...

1. Is Nautilus strongest early?
2. Should I play passive, farming adcs or aggressive ones into him?
3. I want to pick up Kai'sa, because she's cool and because if Riot's going to keep giving people alternate dimensions and team one-shots as ults, and 50% max hp shields on an ability that can deal true damage, I might as well join the "new(ish in the case of Kai'sa) champs with crazy kits" train.  How would she do into Nautilus, specifically in cases of both an aggressive and passive enemy adc?
Nearly every Smurf will duo when they are Smurfing with a Support. Smurfs will likely get an item lead with CS and get more damage off than you with better positioning and kiting. 

Even with that being said High Elo players recognize how hard it is to consistently carry as a solo ADC so they just duo.

Depends on what your goal is.
You want fun?
You want to climb? 
You want to improve?
those low Elo players won't be reading that post though, and they will most certainly not listen to the advice with that condescending tone
I agree with everything in this post, so I just wanna add that you can also trade if you know that you go even in trades but the enemy has lower hp than you due to punishing cs/yanks/whatever. You’ll also win more trades if you go for them while your opponents damage abilities are on cd
What do you take for your keystone then?
So how does a smurf differ from a regular player playing adc. Obviously the smurf is a better player, but if the core concepts are the same what does that smurf do that regular players miss for that sweet carry.
Presence of Mind and Manaflow Band are core runes. 

Manamune > Berserker's/Sanguine Blade, Duskblade, rest situational.

I just picked up zac recently and have been having a blast. Your success with the champ depends on how well you recognize your role in each game. For example, some games you might just perma-peel the ADC, or in others you’ll have to be the main engage to get a fight going. He’s got a ton of CC so you’ll have fun doin either
Generally don't need that much mana, you're sacrificing too much damage (and tempo because of buying Tear) for that.

I would imagine fully stacked Seraph's + Luden's deals more than Luden's + Morello, but it just takes way too long to get there.
Thanks!  Can you tell me which these champs fit into, just so I can understand it a little better?

Olaf, Xin, Sej, Nunu, Kindred, Taliyah
Great guide, thanx dor taking the timw bro, now to you next task : make us a chart of junglers and their speciality xD
Pick a lane, you seem to like mid. Stick with it. When you are sent from champ select or queue dodge in any way, restart the queue. This will help you get mid most times. When stuck in jungle, pick an easy jungler to use, not lee, he may be fun but he's actually hard to play. 
Mechanically/macro/micro, I offer little help
Yes, it's very decent ! it's the basis that i used for this post, i just expanded on how the match-ups interacts with each other and the winning conditions of each type for each match-ups.

Also, I changed what they called "control" junglers for "dueling", as i feel that "control" is a somewhat vague and misunderstood term, but they are basically the same thing.
Isn't "fasting senna"  essentially senna support?
It's not always your team's fault obviously. However you are incredibly reliant on your team, especially your support. If you want to consistently climb you need to be in as much control of the game as possible. ADC has by far the least control of any game state in the vast majority of games.
open practice tool and farm.

learn the speed of your autos as well, especially if you're ranged. you need to watch your minions and learn the rate that the enemy minion's health drops so that you can time the auto.

It’s rough. Ali can make plays but you can’t trade vs that comp only all in. So that first / second wave will dictate a lot. If you were that pushed in you can get work done with ganks. Also if they are up near the tower Ali can always flash Q into W into tower. Again if he’s Ali that’s that passive as a Luc you got nothing you can do. Just recognize fast lane phase is doomed and don’t int. Maybe even hard sac and just 1v2 sit at tower and tell the Ali to roam and get a gank off top etc. Only do this if they haven’t manipulated the lane to a freeze.
Is the role really that dependent on other lanes? ADC is a fun role to play, it just feels as if sometimes games are beyond your control. I'd rather not make the excuse "My team made me lose".
Blue energy thing? If you mean the hammer that fills up, it's called "Frost stacks." Sej's w and her and melee allies' autos stack it. When the hammer is full, she can freeze them, which stuns and lets her auto for a lot of damage.
Thanks for the suggestions! Much appreciated!
I def agree but I have also experienced the split pushers than don't know they should group for dragons/barons and split otherwise leaving us to fight 4v5 in pits which makes it a sad day for our team :( lol. Plus I feel like the 4 group should defend turrets if behind and wait for people to actually chase the splitter before engaging. To many times 2-3 or 4 people just run into the enemies 5 while the splitter is alone and feed the enemy a quadra or worse multiple quadras.
...vayne.

she wins the game at three items. if you're smurfing, then you just get three kills and now no one can stop you snowballing. ff15.
You just need to start with the basics. Don’t worry about champion matchups or making a champion based game plan or worry about supports. 

Your only goals are to get farm and not die with not dying being the priority. If to get some farm you would die or get chunked, it’s not worth to get the farm.

You need to get used to fast ranged auto attacks and farming with ranged auto attacks and kiting backwards. Watch videos on attack moving and kiting and try to focus on this rather than on matchup guides. 

Go into practice tool, buy doran’s blade and see how many CS you can get in 10 minutes without recalling to simulate an actual lane. If it’s below 70 you should practice every time you play until you can get 70-80. Once you do that you need to learn how to kite. Add a beginner bot, don’t buy any items, disable minion spawn and tower shots and auto refresh your hp and practice kiting the bot up and down the lane until you stop misclicking. 

Then learn what your champions combos are, and then you can watch videos on matchup guides.
Dont play ADC if you want to climb with any sort of consistency. Just avoid that role at all costs. Especially below Platinum.
Thank you for the response, also for the guide. 

I looked at items part specifically (will have to read the rest later) and it helped me build a better item set for Azir.

I'll also try out Conq. I did do it at an earlier date but I thought LT was still better. I'll just have to play with it a bit more I guess.

Thanks!
Ingenious is fine, but you do miss out on the hp sustain which may or may not be impactful. It comes down to whether you'll actually want to use your actives on cd. Is your team capable of making picks from your twin shadows.

Second to note is that you should be maxing e second the majority of the time. In the cases where veigar is picked in high elo/ pro play, it's because of his cages ability to stuff engage from certain champions. Champions like aatrox and urgot, who want to be close range to dps, can't really do much into a well placed veigar cage. You want to be able to use it a couple times in a teamfight, or have it constantly up as a zoning tool when contesting objectives. It's really the most valuable part of his kit.

Check out Froggen and Nemesis on twitch for some quality veigar gameplay. I think Veigod, an EU chall veigar player, also streams on twitch. Watch some of their veigar vods and see what you can learn about ability usage and positioning inside fights, as well has how to handle the lane and look for picks.
Yes it is possible if you play sidelanes, I was talking about mid especially. On top if I afkpush I can do 10/min but thats another story.
If you aren’t too attached to playing top, perhaps play jungle. I climbed from Iron 1 to Silver 4 this season by playing jungle. Jungle just has the most influence on the game, and when you have a non existent jungle like your Trundle, you have forfeited the possibility of getting any dragons, especially against a Yi. As jungle, you can at least try to stop your bot lane from getting snowballed by ganking very early on just to establish a lead. Jungle is the win condition, and if you want to climb, you have to take matters into your own hands.
Olaf is one of the best duelist in the game, yes, and his clear is good, but his ganks are terrible and his late-game is one of the weakest there is. 

First picking olaf means the opponent can just go for Kled or Graves, afk farm and outscale you without ever risking dying to you because of their mobility.
So I believe there are three things to consider when deciding which champion to otp:

1: It shouldn't be meta nor off-meta, so you can train the champion when nobody relies on you carrying bc you are so overpowered

2: Try to pick a champion, that mechanically challenges you still after playing it 500-1000 games

3: Personal preference. If a champion really suits your play style and you in general: try it. The most important thi g is that YOU have fun playing the game.
Olaf is exceptional at dueling and decent at farming early on, but lacks lane pressure with minimal CC and falls off hard in the late game.

7-8 cspm is very possible if you have any clue of how to play sidewaves
I think you're taking it too literally as low ground vs. high ground, and not looking at it as a) a meme and b) DRX has wards and river control (metaphorical "low ground") vs. T1 having mid and area outside of pit near red buff (metaphorical "high ground").

Plus they literally joke about being taught that by Ewan McGregor so yeah, they're memeing.
Honestly consider taking a break for a week or two or even a month.
Everyone runs Ingenious Hunter, you have 3+ active items
Stuff like Talon "kind of" counter her because of early pressure makes you close game out before she scales out.

But yes , vel xer vik are legit mirror matches vs her but they arent played much.

Warwick is mainly a dueling jungler i'd say. 

He has decent farming and ganking for sure, but they are not that good compared to other champions. 

even tho he stay healthy while farming his jungle, he take significantly more time doing it than a dedicated farming jungler. 

His ganks are also very easy to see coming : he can't dash through walls like Rek'sai, Kayn or Lee sin, which means that just properly warding the river should make you and your laners pretty safe. 

My advice would be to play a farming jungler that has good escape and can maybe gank better than him, my first thought here would be Nidalee or Hecarim, but there may be more. 
You can also just pick a better dueling jungler like Olaf and force him to rely on one of his weakest points.
Honestly, I learned the jungle types from the League wiki's "Jungling" page.  Maybe you can check it out and tell me if it's decent?
Which role do you play :p
I find jungle is a bit difficult for myself, like I do well in norms but the flame you get just does my head in people expect everything from u
You're getting very good at the assassin shove/roam playstyle, but Annie is closer to teamfight mage / burst playstyle. Orianna might be a better fit for what your'e looking for if you want a "good champ".

But also, I'll be honest - Annie isn't a bad champion. You can play Annie into a ton of matchups, even disadvantageous ones. It makes you better at understanding power spikes, power windows of other champs, and how to change your win conditions. Annie used to be worse without the E speed up, but she's a very simple champion that requires you to be better at fundamentals and game knowledge in order to outplay champions with more in their kit / waiting for them to outplay themselves.
stop playing support or adc before its too late and youre too scared to learn mid jungle or top

get a solo lane.

take control

win lane. control the map. win the game.
I would say jungle.  That position has a huge impact on the success of other lanes.  Combine that with shutting down the opposite jungle and I think that would help the elo struggle.

At least that is my thought process.  I don’t have the best rate or rank either.  But it’s what I am trying to do.
Kinda weird and indeed shameless
I believe his weakness is jack of all trades, master of none.
Yeah it seems obvious, but this post is for lower elo players. That’s where I see people getting camped the most because it works and it’s tilts people really hard.
I understand what you are saying and in this case the tier two in top and bot were up and the tier three in mid was up.

Considering we just got baron and dragon was going to spawn in 30-40 seconds. It would have been more intelligent to group top then. We get the increased gold value from two turrets and also super minions pressuring the top lane while dragon spawns.

The graves was determined to go bot lane with or without the team, I am not even sure if he wanted the team to be with him. Since he made his mind up I should have taken the rest of the team and gone bot with him. The team was together mid and I should have taken the responsibility to ping them off of mid and to group bot with graves. I tried to ping graves off of bot to group with us but realistically the 4 players who were grouping are the ones who are going to listen to commands. The guy splitting solo is not likely to listen so I shouldn't try to get him to listen.
Most toplaners win trades through the use of abilities. Sett for example has a combo, E them to CC, hit them with 2 Q autos, then wait for the counter damage to build grit, then blast them with a true damage W.

He wants to keep repeating this combo until a W takes you low enough to all in.

He thrives off of long, extended trades where he can build grit to both get nutty health regen, as well as blast you with super saiyan Ws.

So, you basically do the opposite. Trade when he doesn't have abilities, or make short trades so he can't effectively build grit.

As shen I usually pull sword, whack him 1-2 times, then back off. W allows me to block the Q autos, and I can taunt away/to the side  if he trades back with W. Repeat to keep hurting him so he's scared to all in, then just farm.

Other strategies include the triple rejuv bead start (good if you're a high base health regen champ), getting a corrupting pot, etc.
This is more of a post for lower elo players who find themselves getting camped by the enemy jungler a lot. I see it happen quite a bit and most of the time people just rage quit or afk or just give up.
Dunno what elo you play in, but in low elo its mostly true. You miss some cs anyway as a low elo player, but unless you play a splitpusher, farming instead of roaming/teamfighting is inferior in low elo imo. You can try to farm hard, but your roaming opponent will be much more ahead if he can get kills at sidelanes as mid, as most teammates lack map awareness, even if you ping. 

There is a reason roaming assassins are top tier right now. 

In high elo its more farming less fighting, but in lower elo its aram from min 20 almost every game. You either split on a champ like Trynd or you are forced to join teamfights or your team engages/gets caught 4v5 losing the game and flaming you.
? Two squishys vs an engage tank, you don't sit around waiting to be poked down.
Annie is not a bad champion, no champion is really bad unless you are playing Akali or Tahm kench for solo queue. Pretty much every other champion is fine specifically for solo queue.

And honestly you should just play what you enjoy. Annie might be slightly better in the fact she is similar to other mage mid laners, but if you enjoy melee mid laners play those. There are also other mage mid laners you could learn over annie if that is what you want. It doesn't have to be her. It's not a big deal really.
No one is blaming the announcer. It's just doing what it is programmed to do. 

We have the ability to remove the announcer from the game, that's what this thread is about

This guide will help you cs. It's a bit old so I believe the new number is 46/48 cs

There are 2 things to consider when looking at csing well
1. Are you getting every cs while you're in lane and not dealing with an immediate threat
2. Are you managing the wave properly and using correct back timings to ensure you're not missing very much cs when you have to

This is just for laning phase. But for now I would focus on #1 as it's easier and possibly more essential, then afterwards you can focus on #2
To reliably hard carry in low elo, you have to be smurfing. To carry in low elo, you have to win your lane either through CS leads or kills.

To climb in low elo, you just need to not tilt and win lane more times than you lose lane. You may have games like this where the enemy team was clearly better than your team. But in the next game you’ll have players of your own skill level, and you need to be better than them in some way and the easiest way in low elo is to onetrick a champion and a role, because many people play tons of different champions in iron and bronze and through diamond thinking “oh I had a good game with them in a normal game so I can play them in ranked.”

You just need to practice your combos in practice tool and practice farming. You should be able to hit 80 CS by 10 minutes in practice tool just farming without recalling after some practice. Then if you can do this, you just need to learn when to recall. For low elo, when you want to recall push the wave into their tower and then recall. Or if you can’t then you can recall and TP back to lane with full hp. The most important thing is that creeps not only give gold but also XP for just being near them when they die. Having an XP lead is huge and can win you games.
Warwick's ganks aren't particularly good until level 6. At level 3 he can pull off a gank but even then there are better gankers. And at level 6 there's Nocturne, Shyvana and Evelynn if you wanted to talk about gankers!

Warwick's dueling falls off later game unless he got fed. He's also less effective in general.

Warwick's solid at farming the whole game, but he cannot farm raptors or krugs effectively until Tiamat.

So he's strong at all 3 but he has a weakness in all 3.
Or just pick Olaf lol
A+ for the vivid imagination.. lmao
No he's right.

Theres a bunch of people spouting generalities without specifying context.

Point of thread is to dispel this idea that they should focus on 10 cs/min games , especially with champ, roles and elo being factors.

Specifying that 10 cs/min during first 10 mins is a realistic pursuit is totally fine however. Or get as close to it as possible.

Guy above is using smurfing on split pushing irelia top as example...

Imagine going to poppy mains or leblanc mains or talon mains and telling them they should really be striving to hit 9 cs/min per game...

I had this tirade with another poster CONVINCED that he should be hitting 8-9 cs/min with Zoe per game ..mean while Perkz avgs 7 cs/min on Zoe. And every other high elo zoe main is in the ~6 cs/min .

10 cs/min is not applicable MOST of the time depending on champ role and elo. It is not a good pursuit of focus. New players or people who just dont know would find out the best players on their specific champs might be just 1 cs/min higher than them for example. So that's an achievable healthy realistic goal. Not this nebulous overarching fallacy.

Yes theres standards like aiming for good income like 7 cs/min more or less . Last hitting properly, wave management and back timings. But I invite people to have  a frame of reference to what is achievable for their champ/role by looking at the best players. 

In what universe would the adc be the one rotating mid and missing cs ? Its the other way around. 

Theres specifics in 10 cs/min.
yes you lose a lot of dmg mid game compared to sorcs+orb, or delay your zh+deathcap+void staff pretty significantly.


> I'm playing Taliyah

especially on taliyah. want extra mana? take pom. ruining your giant mid game powerspike isnt worth it.
What is Warwick’s weakness? He seems good at all 3. Not saying you’re wrong or anything I just want to know so I can go against him better
The hardest part about gnar in low elo imo is getting your team to play around your rage. I’d say give him a shot if he is interesting to you but be prepared to tilt when your team engages when you have no rage.
That's an interesting point here, but i think it's only partially true : 

While you can indeed countergank as a farming jungler, it is not often used as a mean to straight up kill the opposing jungler, but rather reducing his pressure on the lane and ultimately making him get less value out of the gank. 
If you can kill him with your laner, then that's even better, but your "goal" as a farming jungler in this match-up is to maximize your own income while making sure the ganking jungler can't effectively give more ressources to his team. 

I also want to point out that, as said in the post, most junglers have some parts of these three traits to varying degrees, what this mean is that a farming jungler may have even a little bit a dueling power in him, and then yes, he can try to play around this specific traits to counter someone that is actively ganking all the time. He may not be very good at it originally (as in it's not his main trait), but in a specific match-up, this would be the correct way to play for him. 

This post aim at isolating these traits in order to make them easyer to understand, but most champions are not that binary in how they can play the jungle.
I'd uninstall the game and throw myself off a cliff
Warden's mail, it reduces attack speed on hit. You can also upgrade it to frozen heart which gives aura attack speed reduction or thornmail if enemy team has lots of healing.
I mostly agree, but sometimes all we can do is try to find what scraps of logic can be grabbed.
I'm looking for another champion to pick mid. I'm currently playing ahri and tc because of their roam potential and wave clear. I really like having a lot of influence on the map as well as having pick potential in fights. Is there another champ is able to be as influential as my other 2 picks?
Took me getting double flash EQR’d too many times to realize I’d rather face my counter pick in bot early than any half decent Zoe mid/late
Play something like chogath or Malphite. 
I am a garbage player learning to main top for clash and those two have very obvious trade winning skills, like wait fro commet and shield passive then Q people on malphite and you win. 
If you hit Q on cho then go pro grasp and win a free trade.
I don’t want to support toxic people but I have seen stuff like that happen. In one match as Nautilus support I had an Ashe ADC that ran from every fight without fail, laning phase, teamfights, even a hook under tower. And as an aggressive Nautilus it hurts having to tank your way back to safety because nobody followed up on an advantageous engage.
If you’re playing tanks, your goal isn’t to win lane it’s to win team. Gold on your carries is better than gold on you. Objectives help everyone. When you tp bot, do you stay and help get tower? Not always the right call but sometimes it is. After a drag fight, can you do something mid on your way back top? Ultimately when you’re a tank playing against a champ that you can’t match in a side lane, don’t try and match in a side lane. Get out of laning phase as soon as possible and group with your team.
As someone who plays a split push style champ, the most difficult thing to control is getting objectives while my team wants to pick stupid fights. Especially if top doesn’t have tp, they can’t match your rotations.
How long have you actually tried to get better?
You don’t have to eat only healthy foods just try to eat one thing healthy once a day and go to sleep at the same time every night and drink lots of water.
In League there isn’t going to be a set build that you’ll go every single game on any champion. Outside of a core 1-3 items, you can wildly change the items that you build from game to game depending on the champions on the other team, the champions on your team, and the items that your team/the enemy team are building. Azir’s core build generally ends up being Nashor’s and sometimes Luden’s. For example, if your team happens to be entirely AP damage one game, then it might be wise to get some strong magic penetration after your Nashor’s tooth. In this case maybe you would get Void Staff and a Liandry’s Torment to help you shred through the magic resist that will be built against you. Maybe the other team has a lot of squishies, so in that case a Zhonya’s would be good because those squishies will require less damage to kill.
That's accurate, I was merely pointing out that your point was correct and universally true as opposed to being relevant. Good day.
Azir's a great champion! I studied him for a bit, largely by following Xerhu's example. Here's a guide he made, but I'll tell you my own thoughts too. They largely follow his though tbh.

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/18RvS9UW7ZBPoLNxh6omclPeYmtbY4ULxER23DQpkaKQ/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18RvS9UW7ZBPoLNxh6omclPeYmtbY4ULxER23DQpkaKQ/edit#)

Good decision from not building a ludens if you build nashors. For Azir, Ludens and Nashors are more of an early game spike item so if you build it later on it's just delaying other important items (Zhonyas, Banshee's, Rabadon's, Liandry's, Sorc boots, Morello...) and won't have a massive impact compared if you built them early on.

Ludens is good for poke/burst. Azir *can* poke and he *can* burst, but it's not his specialty. It's good to build Ludens first if you're like vs. 4 poke champions so you can poke them back. If you do that you may as well not even build Nashors.

Rod of Ages can be a solid item. I've seen one korean azir player use RoA almost every game. I personally don't use it but if you do I suggest you use conqueror rune with it.

Rylai's scepter is okay if you benefit from the slow, but honestly it's kind of niche compared to the benefit Azir gets from other items.

Zhonyas, Banshees and Liandry's are all solid 3rd items. Morellos is also a solid 3rd or 4th item if they have a heal-heavy team (Let's say Tryndamere top and Soraka support. Even more important if they also have a warwick jungle...)

Azir's first powerspike is nashor's tooth and he can be powerful at 3 items. The reason you don't really feel the powerspike until that late is probably because you're going Lethal Tempo.

Don't underestimate void staff's damage through penetration. I remember seeing math done that showed Void Staff + Sorc Shoes does more damage than Rabadon's Cap starting at 50 MR. That's like, 1 MR item for most champions. (Void Staff + Sorc Shoes added together has similar gold cost to Rabadon's Cap, that's why sorc shoes were included. Obviously void is cheaper than cap). Rabadons gives a better shield on e though, since its more raw AP.

You should experiment more with **conqueror** specifically, it's stronger early game than Lethal Tempo by a mile and it still scales later game a bit. This will help you feel Azir's power earlier game. Lethal tempo is great on Azir if you can rely on your team to help you carry. That's not consistent in soloq, though. Conqueror, however, is very consistent.

Also try out **Comet** and **Hail of Blades.** HoB is very strong early game for Azir vs. many champions and Comet is great vs. some ranged lanes. If you can get a lead early game or bully your opponent into nonexistence, great!
Nothing, you just lose. Your lane can't do much unless the other lane is really bad. It's one of the issues when you are in a lane that is dependent on another person.
My mouse dpi is a little high. I sometimes click it playing champs like Akali or ADCs. I locally click in the direction and then right click map and go there. I'm always prepared to hit space if needed while doing that. It would be better to never accidentally hit map though, or if you could zoom out ever so slightly more. I have quick movement and am super accurate but some how hit the flippin map lol
I mean sure, if you want to be pedantic, but aggressive Exhaust is clearly more relevant than aggressive Cleanse/Barrier or defensive Ignite.
My bad. You right.
Champ viability does not matter until diamond. If you like playing Shaco do it
The most passive people in my games are fed ADCs and then they blame jg or supp for lost team fights that they ran away from with full health
I’ll give it a try! Thanks!
I did the majority of that and it’s help so far. Jungle is by far my weakest roll and I am bad with the pathing of it. I am going to start playing it more in norms to start understanding it a bit better and think that will help. The thing I haven’t done is transfer the icons to the top left. Is that in the regular in game settings?
Let’s be real. The best defense against Zoe is in the ban phase
What I meant is that at a professional level, this advantage is so minimal I don't even think it's worth mentioning. I actually think DRX has the better position here.

If T1 tries to start dragon as blue side, it's much harder to disengage after taking it because they have to walk all the way around, whereas when DRX takes it as red side, they can disengage very quickly.
I played for many years and maybe got auto fill maybe once. What is your secondary pick?
You are funneling thru a choke to get into river. Has nothing to specifically do with high or low ground other than the fact that to go from high to low ground you run thru chokepoints

It’s less so playing too safe and moreso knowing your power spikes vs your opponents. Veigar is a scaling champion that gains kill pressure after 6 (assuming you also have sorc boots and an item or so). You have to know when your opponent is strong as well. Veigar sets up ganks very well, but in a straight 1v1, most of the time you just have to try to whittle them down, zone them away from cs if they are melee (auto the hell out of them-it adds up) and building a gold/xp advantage through proper wave management  and recall timings if you can’t gain a lead early through straight kill pressure. Just realize that you want to be even or ahead after laning phase, but you don’t have to be giga-fed. That comes through natural scaling and team fights. You as a champion will always be useful as long as you don’t get caught out in fights.
The fact that the champions picked can have even a slight influence on how likely you are to win the game is a big thing. There are 10 players in every game, so one champion is only responsible for a 10th of what happens in any game, and a lot of what happens is down to individual decision-making, and nothing to do with the capabilities of the champion they're playing. A champion would have to be comically overpowered to have so much influence that someone who normally has a 50% winrate playing against people of equal skill to get a big winrate increase just by picking a different champion.

To put it another way wukong has the highest winrate of any champion in the game right now (when a decent sample size is taken), so by that metric he's the strongest. Winrates very rarely go over 55% for any champion, esp not one with a high pickrate.

That being said winrate certainly isn't everything. Less popular champions often manage higher winrates just because the only people who are playing them are mains, or have lots of experience on them. Something else riot considers that we don't get to see is how well people who have lots of experience on a champion perform on them, irelia was actually I belive an example they gave in that case (along with aatrox and some others). She's a popular champion with a high skill floor (not very accessible) so overall her winrate is low, but in the hands of someone who's experienced on her it's quite a bit higher, and (from personal experience) she's very scary when played well, because there's a big difference mechanically between a good irelia and a bad one. Technically nobody is as experienced on wukong yet, since he just got a mini-rework so that's another reason it's alarming his winrate is so high. Usually champions' winrate climb for a few patches after release/rework as people get better at them.
My advice is to find something that you think looks fun and roll with it. Cause when you’re having fun, win or loss doesn’t matter nearly as much. I started playing Sylas on my smurf and I’ve been having a ton of fun learning my limits. My most recent “oh shit that was nutty” moment was when I killed a Lux level 3 with Sylas when I was nearly dead.

In short, give Sylas a look. He can flex Mid or Top.
Unfortunately with a yi that fed it's a loss unless your team can stall for a long time to be able to compete with the Yi. You can still carry a game from your teammates feeding a lot. You have to play smart, and play obj, try to kill an enemy while they are alone. Dont teamfight unless they arent fully grouped cause you'll lose. In that situation it was just a loss. Iron/bronze are notorious for someone feeding so hard that they kind of just give up but you have to keep a calm head and play to your team's strengths.
1 he is an adc and I play top
2 I don’t care about popularity or streaming
3 even high level players have weaknesses 

I just want to improve
Thx I will
For me I feel like that there is only so much attention a person can give. In life when I want to get something done quick i hyper focus on it and get it done. But this game seems like it’s has so many different things going on that I have to manage, and manage well to become really good at it. And that’s the part I struggle with is managing everything efficiently.
I like the fact that you took the rune, actively thinking about how to use it best (shows that you have an understanding of them, which some people don’t bother doing). Your ult and your E are the most impactful part of your kit. Your active items just enable you better, so Ult CDR is your best bet in most cases
It's over, Obi-Wan! I have the low ground!

You pretty much answered your own question though didn't you? At the professional level people want any advantage they can get, no matter how tiny. A little visual change can be an advantage.
Two things that helped me are:

1. Play one of those champs. Learn exactly how much damage you can take and exactly how much you can deal. Some fights are won by a sliver, and you want that sliver to be in your favor. Playing all 4 of those champs essentially quadruples the time it takes to learn every matchup.

2. Get a coach. There are (I believe) weekly posts on this subreddit where coaches post to offer completely free coaching. It's more fun than you think it would be.
Hey, ive been maining Olaf top on EUW, atm in D4. What you want to do is be really agressive early lvls 1-3. If you somehow die or get ganked just wait for next powerspike lvl6, one axe and you are almost guaranteed a kill. Make sure you take approach velocity. Also about mana problems biscuits is a good choice to counter that in the early game. 

Also try to end the laning-phase quick since olaf is all about early game (pre 25min). Make sure to take the top turret asap and group up with your team, thats how you win. 

Good luck on the rift with the Berserker
This actually isn’t recommended. As someone who has coached and received coaching, games that you performed poorly, and you’re aware that you did poorly, don’t help anyone, because it 1. Isn’t you at your average level of play 2. Half the mistakes the coach will point out will be responded with “yeah I don’t normally do that” or something of that nature. 

Note to the OP: just because you found a game that you did just okay on, and you can identify your mistakes, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t pick it. I’m sure there are a lot deeper things that the coach can pick up on. 

The best types of games you can pick are the following:

-a game that was very close between the two teams that ended either in a win or loss (these are the best, because there is a lot of information to get out of these. If you can find one where you did average in, all the better. You want to find the most average game you can.)

-a game that (in the case of Junglers), your pathing didn’t get messed up due to a lvl 1 invade that forced you to path differently. This is a good example if you’re sampling multiple games, but you want the coach to see you play how you normally do, that way you get more out of it.

-a game where you are playing a champion that you are comfortable to on. This way the coach is less likely to focus on basic mechanical errors (you can coach yourself on this watching YouTube videos) and can help you more with your macro play.
G to ping. Farm is practice. Playing a champion with wave clear also helps
This helped me a lot because I didn't know this, but I think it's still good to leave that goal there to make sure your cs remains healthy, even if you'll never reach 10/min in every situation.
P1 jg main just a comment on this one: 

>**Ganking** vs **Farming**  
>  
>You probably guessed it, but this one is in favor of the ganking jungler. The reason for it is quite simple : Both of these junglers want to have the minimum interactions with each other as possible, so they are virtually free to do whatever they want.

Any good farming jungler should know that your goal is to countergank. You dont avoid the ganking jungler, you track them and follow them.
Winrates are deceptive. There's more reason why people say Wukong is strong right now than his winrate.

The logic behind a \~5% difference being good/bad is that it makes it that much harder or easier to win using that champion. People want to have an average winrate of like **\~80%**, so imagine having a goal that lofty when the average winrate of your champion makes it harder to achieve that. However, a winrate doesn't equate to how good or bad a champion is. Akali was (pretty sure) below a 50% winrate even before her final wave of nerfs and people still absolutely despised her and a fair amount called her OP. So you need to try and think about why a champion has a certain winrate.

I'd say Wukong is strong because he's a bruiser with an ult that's absolutely insane and has really obnoxious abilities that help him get away with stuff other champions can't. His winrate reflects that experience, so I'd say it's probably accurate.

Irelia is harder to pinpoint, because there are at least 2 things to keep in mind. She's not really an easy champion to play as, so new people using her would artificially lower her winrate. That said, I'd say she's still at least below average. Once you know how Irelia works, she's very easy to work around. Don't get hit by the stun and don't start a fight when her when her passive is stacked and you win on probably any champion, so long as you're both on similar gold/items. So, her winrate is probably accurate.

(That said you can still play Irelia, she's not an awful champion. But people do generally agree she isn't easy to play and isn't in a good spot right now.)
I hope a lot of non-junglers will read this and try to understand some of the dynamics of jungling as opposed to just focusing on if they are able to gank your lane at the exact millisecond you want them too no matter where they are on the map or what they are doing to try and ensure map control, objectives, and the safety of other lanes.
I'm not sure, if anything is weighting on my mind. I live alone, so I can do whatever I want, whenever I want.
I do have bad sleeping habits, because I like to late night game, but I switched to playing singleplayer games at night, not league ranked, unless I decide to play league anyway. I'm skinny af, but I eat a lot, I'm not eating healthy, I lack the will to switch to healthy foods.
Thats a terrible matchup for your side. You have to hope your side can find good allin windows and that your jungler ganks them when they overextend.

The problem is that Cait's and Xerath's poke ranges are higher then Alistars engage range, and on top of that Ali's engage is super predictable and easy to counter by Cait E or Xerath E.

Make sure you dont lose to much health in the early levels. Alistar is not a champion level 1, you have to respect that and give up cs if necessary. If you get poked down early to a point where you would lose an allin even when Alistar finds an engage, your lane is lost.

So stay healthy, build early lifesteal / take defensive runes lIke cookies (or second wind) and hope your Alistar finds good allin windows.
 
And if possible try to manipulate the wave to position on your side of the lane close to your turret. That way its easier for you to find good allins and easier for your team to gank.
Very great words of wisdom here! How about taking one step further for us and making a list of which champions fall under what categories? Or at least doing the top 5-10 meta junglers as a start :)
It's all about positioning. Try this trick, look at your allied cannon minion, when it is about to die (about 2 auto attacks from death) #1 = walk up to your dying allied cannon minion. The enemy adc will ***always*** go for the cannon minion. The split second before your allied cannon minion dies, the enemy adc will walk right up to it to attempt to last hit it (you need to visualize where they will be standing when they attempt this last hit and anticipate that exact spot). You should be in range of the enemy adc (see #1). #2 = cast velkoz E + W + Q for a guaranteed full combo. Make sure there are no enemy minions between you and the adc so you can hit em with the Q. This combo is not limited to the allied cannon minion dying. You will find ADCs, especially in lower elo, will leave themselves horribly exposed when farming. Try throwing your velkoz abilities when the enemy adc goes for farm!

The trick is setting up the positioning. As stated in #1, walk up to your allied dying minions!

Edit: you can 100% carry iron as velkoz support, I think it is much better than mid
????? none of that is true
Agree, plus anivia isn’t an easy champ to learn. Froggen May make it look easy, but she’s not. I’d prefer velkoz, swain, or malz low elo.
I've actually had a weirdly high amount of success just saying 'Sorry' in the most sincere way that can be delivered in text after they complain at me. Even if I feel like I wasn't the source of the mistake. Usually I just write "I'm Sorry." or "Sorry." That's it.

Over half of the time they say nothing positive in response, they largely ignore the apology and continue whatever the hell they want to do. But sometimes I do get a response and it's always either been either funny or wholesome.

Alternatively you can just mute, because there's absolutely no way you can expect saying sorry to help. I just don't really get tilted easily, so I try to reduce allied tilt by apologizing for things that piss them off. Best case scenario it helps, worst case scenario they ignore it and continue flaming. Nothing to lose really, since they'd flame anyway.
Imo for an ADC it is a good metric to aim for as they need to catch up with others in items and levels; for other roles it is not the same. It is why in most of the high elo games and pro-play they let adc farm more even in ARAM stages of the game.
It isn't true that games are decided quickly. There are a lot of throws in this elo, and pings won't usually stop them. From what I understood you want to be a factor in teamfights.
Maybe sej? I picked her up for clash and I've been spamming her since. She's super fun imo. Good ganks, plays well into late game. Tons of cc. And cc wins games. Team always has a front line and engage. Only down side imo is it's preferable you have at least 1 other melee champion on your team. I know to some people tanks aren't fun, but she does consistent damage. You're still valuable even if you're behind, bc of your cc. If you're ahead you're basically unkilable. She's an all around solid pick imo
Take a mage bot.  It’s freelo.
for the longest time i was aiming to get 10cs/min and was averaging 6-7, and my brother who was gold(i was silver) at the time kept telling me that i need to farm better and I just couldn't
Yeah, but what I'm saying is that exhaust now is completely different from exhaust back then, so you can't really use that as evidence.

Also, the build of one player doesn't mean anything. For example, [this guy](https://www.op.gg/summoner/userName=zer%EA%B7%B8%EB%A7%81) peaked Korean Challenger 582 LP with Zilean top...

except he builds GLP, Mortal Reminder, Swiftness Boots, Nashor's, Deadman's Plate, Witt's End, Seraph's, Spellbinder, Banshee's, Twin Shadows, Abyssal Mask, Adaptive Helm, Void Staff, Luden's Echo, , Zhonya's, and Righteous Glory (choose 6 and he's probably built that at one point).

And for keystones, he runs anything from Aery to Grasp to Press the Attack to Unsealed Spellbook.

Sure, maybe Tank/On-hit/AP hybrid Zilean top is actually somehow good, but I don't find it likely.
Not always being able to even recognize the mistake you made. It happens to just me soooooo often, where my high elo buddy is like "why the fuck are you doing that"
Thats true but at the same time, i feel like typing and communicating that way is a bit better? I mean, you have to step out of the fight first yeah, but it sends a message that you sometimes cant get in pings.


Also thanks for the video! Ill be sure to watch it!
personally I  use T for camera reset and space for attack move click. And I actually pretty much always navigate offscreen via the minimap, after a while you stop clicking it on accident
Well, you kinda can. For example I was going to play one more game, I got autofilled support. Support is the one role I just can't really play well, so I dodged and went to bed instead.

I woke up, queued, got my main role (mid). But yup, you get autofill protection for like 2\~? games and trying to dodge autofill doesn't work very well.
What's your secondary position? As someone else stated previously, you can't be autofilled more than once in a row, you get protected against it.
I play as a jungler in Iron and I'm for the second time in Iron IV. I feel that in a lot of games I have to play perfectly or I will lose. It's rare to see wards, when the enemy jungler invades me I have to pray that my laners will react and let me get some farm and in the mid-late game I have to choose to take a drake, push a turret or join the random coinflip fight. I have a lot to improve on and I'm trying to do that. I can't figure out if it's better to play a duelist jungler that can be impactful early on and still be good later or a farming-centered teamfight one.

So my tips from a jungler perspective are:

\- Don't cry for ganks but call one if you are sure that you can kill your laner

\- Ward a lot. Always buy control wards and if you have priority invade the enemy jungle to steal a camp or two or even just place deep vision. Deep vision will help a lot if your team watches the map. You can ward the enemy raptors with yellow trinket for example, or place a control ward in a meaningful bush. If your jungler is being invaded you can even consider to put a ward in your jungle if you don't have priority. If the enemy opened up the map you should probably ward your jungle to avoid ambushes.

\- Try to understand where the enemy jungler is. Sure, your jungler should do it, but if you want to really improve as a player you should have a general idea of where he is and what he wants to do.

I don't know if you are making other mistakes and maybe you should focus on those ones but these are my 2 cents.
Is there a resource somewhere that allows me to see which junglers are better at these 3 things?
Sivir is really strong, secretly a hypercarry lategame, cockblocks all the popular supports (thresh/naut/blitz) with her spellshield.
Have you tried something very different to Dairus? Like Kennen, Teemo or Jayce.

If you're performing bad with Sett, it may be because you want Sett to be like Darius, and you engage thinking on what Darius can do, not Sett.
Yes, sometimes your jungler is exactly that. Because if a laner decides to go 0/4/0  six minutes in the game, there is no way a gank is successful. Then you as a jgler just farm exp and look after other lanes/objectives. There is no way I will gank your 4/0/0 darius when I am lvl 5
Pick garen mid, press W when the shark comes, silence him so he can't hop away, build wit's end 1st or second item.
Yeah, biscuits is probably the best rune in that slot for Veigar.

I don't main Veigar, but I'm pretty sure he does enough damage to minions that he doesn't benefit from dematerializer. That only leaves future's market. That's great for champions who need an item spike, but I think Veigar more just relies on his in-built AP scaling. Just something I always ask myself when I take biscuits: do I really need them?
He's kinda busted, 51% winrate, very high playrate, only counters are things no-one plays like tanks mid and kayle. I guess kassadin is ok as well. Even if he loses lane once he hits lategame he's still going to oneshot your backline then ult out and laugh, then do it again 30 seconds later.

He's like a kassadin without being a minion pre-6 and without needing a million mana.
That’s why I’m waiting until everyone on my team is in gold every single game, that way I’ll know my mmr is at least high enough to get me into high bronze.
I try some wacky builds, but I've never heard of that.

What items does Manamune Draven use?
The first thing is to just listen to your instinct. If you suspect the enemy jungler is in the bush, don’t walk up and ward it. You are thinking to yourself, well maybe he isn’t in the bush. But there is a high chance that he is, so just don’t do it. More often than not, your first instinct is right.

As for focusing, you need to make sure you are eating well, sleeping well, and not playing ranked when you aren’t getting enough sleep and eating only snacks at odd hours. Also when you have other things to be doing, like errands that you need to do, do them first so they aren’t weighing on your mind.
At least pantheon jungle isn't as tricky as karthus or shaco or taliyah clears.

Seriously I was just watching a replay of mine to see what I was doing wrong as a mid laner, and I noticed karthus jg on my team recalling at like level 3 at wolves with almost no hp. I rewind to see if I missed an invade.

Nope, he just didn't kite and nearly died. The support lux came to help him clear wolves because they solo killed lane and she noticed he was struggling. Ouch.
I've been advised to just use Presence of Mind on Anivia for her mana issues, which works as support at least.

I'm skeptical that she can afford the early game hit for rushing it mid.
Thanks for the input! I use biscuits to keep my mana up to keep farming with Q early. Most matchups I get shoved in a couple times because of trying to maximize minions killed with Q

I try not to take my first back until I can buy Lost Chapter most games. Biscuits help a ton in that regard because I hardly ever get poked out of lane, instead I run out of mana from using Q.
Unfortunately in the current state of the game the supports control bot lane while the ADCs are really jus along for the ride. The best thing to do when your support is getting beaten out by a more aggressive pick like pyke, blitz, or xerath is to focus on farming. Against pyke, blitz or thresh I would suggest taking TP because it’s almost impossible to win all ins against those four. So it’s better to just focus on farming while dodging their hooks. Also, if your premades with your support talk about them counter picking whatever they pick. (For example picking blitzcrank into pyke works almost every time.)
You dont need any tip or guide, get better, improve your game knowledge.
THIS! Thank you I’m glad someone said it! Especially in lower Eli a lot of laners don’t look at what the jungler is doing ever. It is not too difficult to glance at the map and health bars every 10 seconds or so.
Yeah there are just some champions who don't really roam. They can, but most people will expect that you don't. Veigar and Viktor are the two big ones I can think of. They aren't artillery mages AND they aren't fast. That said you shouldn't never roam, but it's kind of difficult to learn when is a good time on those champions. If your lane is pushed up and your opponent roams bot, you can probably follow their roam bot through the safety of your jungle. That doesn't mean you should be afraid to leave to help your jungler: Even Veigar should help his jungler out when he's in trouble at the jungle/scuttle!

Veigar is a solid pick at low elo though and still sees play at high elo. Just keep at it I say, make sure you're building right for him and stuff like Laulicon started looking into. The GLP build you showed can be effective (the rune change Gangsir suggested is good. Ravenous for sustain, ultimate hunter otherwise) pretty sure. If you take footwear you definitively aren't roaming until you get the boots though.

I would maybe try testing out not getting biscuits on some matchups, I'm always afraid of using biscuits as a crutch for poor lane mechanics, but honestly it's probably the best rune in that row for Veigar I guess.
I'll try it out, just thought it's nice to have lower cd on GLP and Twin Shadows. Thanks for the input!
Hahah this was hilarious to read, thank you. I try my best as a mid main to stay alive while also exerting enough pressure so my team can stay afloat
You can't dodge an Autofill.  


You get Autofill protection after playing a game where you were Autofilled.   


>My last 8 games i got autofilled into Support or Jungle and I don't see how that's fair

  
You played yourself by dodging.
could be your mmr screwing you over. My normals mmr is a lot lower than my ranked mmr, and I curbstomp everything in normals, but will sometimes get rekt in ranked. Play a bit more and see what happens. If they get easier, then it's not your fault.
Ingenious hunter is usually taken by ganking junglers or supports so they can use sweeper more. I would personally take ravenous or ultimate hunter if I were you.
I prefer amumu over warwick as a first jungler for a few reasons. Warwick is the autofill jungler you play when you don't know how to play jungle but still want to be useful. Amumu is the champ you play when you want to learn jungle since he exposes your mistakes more and punishes you for bad pathing or bad plays. It's really obvious when you make a bad play on amumu, on warwick not so much.

As amumu you have clear strengths and weaknesses and goals which helps you figure out what to do: decent ganks but really bad at actually fighting especially 1 v 1, solid clear but limited by mana, (so needs blue or scuttles) OP in 5 v 5 fights and in general lategame.

Because warwick does everything ok you don't really get punished for fucking up and you can get into any bad habits. I think warwick is also harder than he seems with E timing, Q tricks, hitting your R etc.
What u/ooAku said, but I would add that you also need to consider likely hood of different outcomes of the plays you could try. If a play 'could' have high value if things 'go well' it can still be a poor choice if the odds of things 'going well' is too low.

There are times I stay top and work to keep myself strong when bot is losing because the outcome of staying top is more reliable than the plays I could attempt bot side.

To this end my main suggestion is to focus on how to be doing better in your own match up so you will in some games have more options and the choices you make are more likely to work out.

Since Maokai is one of the champions you play, if you do not already you should [watch Azio who is a challenger Maokai one trick.](https://www.twitch.tv/aizolol/) I know there are challenger Poppy one tricks out there, but I am not sure of a good way to observe there games.
Look into this [youtuber](https://youtu.be/X0ta-2Q9wyE).

He explains classes and subclasses, there is a sheets link in his description, make a copy and read it and it will show your top 3 classes according to what you like.

Volibear for example is a Juggernaut. Other Juggernauts you can try in jungle are Olaf, Sett, Shyvana, Skarner, Trundle and Udyr. If you are not interested in the champions I listed I highly recommend going to the link and filling your preferences then you'll know what other classes you might be interested in.
Works unless your team gets killed and leaves 3-4 enemies alive and they take inhibs before you can base. Or they take every objective on the map and you have to deal with soul and elder.
Im talking about times when your team has already lost a 4v5 and they are gearing up for round 2 type stuff.
Urgot sounds like what you want. Has a great early and can come back even if behind. Similar to Voli, you can chase down people with righteous glory and demolish them. Urgot is tanky and is your standard juggernaut. However, he can't really be played jungle but if your looking for a secondary role urgot top might be for you.
In B1 on ADC my best games are like 6.8. Farming side waves is a huge risk due to the ARAM. Also makes it very hard to catch up.
I’ve had a few games in which I had to farm to where I thought the minions where, since I had to be watching everywhere for the enemy jg to appear, mid is horrible... *and that’s from an adc*
Unfortunately in the current state of the game bot lane is a clown fiesta between the supports and junglers, with ADCs just along for the ride. If you queue up with a good support or jungler you will be able to focus more on your lane.
Or you could take a mistake and learn from it. Why play a mode to test your skills if someone is going to immediately tell you how to be better? This is a good idea, just not for ranked. This would be better for VERY new players in bot games only
buy a cull
Learn when you and your enemy power spike. Play safe, ward, check map often, and play around when you are powerful.
I also learned a tip that every three or so minions you last hit just look at the minimap
If you send a replay over to me, I could give you more insight onto what's going on. You know how to send a replay?
Both are good right now, though panth jungle takes some practice because you have to use his abilities properly in order to have a decent clear. Virkayu has a video on pantheon jungle I would recommend watching it to see if your interested.
Current state is pick ban totally broken I believe. We'll have to see how they nerf him before coming to conclusions.

My guess is he becomes a flanker/duelist that just destroys backlines if he gets a flank off like hecarim but is kinda weak to stuff like poppy that can knock him away when he ults or jax who he can't match in a sidelane.
I prefer panth in the jungle for sure
Just gotta farm as much as you can. After backing or death, you can type to your support and ask politely to play a bit more aggressive, just don't be mean about it. If you can, tell them who you'd like to target, or tell them you'll ping when you want to fight, or ask them how THEY think the lane should play out. There's still a bunch of people that don't know that Supports are supposed to lead in lane, so some players just don't want to mess up in lane for your sake!

Your positioning is a factor too though! You should double check to see if your in a good position to fight if a support starts one. Ali might be a tank, but he needs lv 2 to do anything, and he'll easily lose a 1v2. Lucian does have a dash, but Ali needs to be pretty far up to fight. We don't have a video to see, so just don't be too quick to blame this on your supports. I've seen plenty of passive Supports, but I've also seen a ton of passive ADC too. But other then that, communication goes a long way m8!
This is how you play adc -> think about which support can kill the ADC easier and play accordingly. 

Try to maximize farm while doing it, most important goal is NOT DYING.

Get 2 items at a reasonable time in game and start dealing DPS in teamfights GG
Thank you. Never thought about playing renekton may have to give it a try
I don't play Fiora, but I'm sure fellow members of r/FioraMains can help you there
Thank you I’ll look into zac more then
I think the problem is setting a goal and a strategy beforehand. Talk to the support at the start of the game, ask how they are going to play. Alistar couldn't do much against xerath early on unless you set up coordinated all in.
Would you suggest pantheon going top or jungle? Not sure where to play him as I haven’t after his rework
Glacial Augment>Footwear>Biscuits>Cosmic Insight

Taste of Blood>Ingenious Hunter

Adaptive,Adaptive,MR or Armor
I change boots to stopwatch in runes if I play against something like Yasuo/Talon/Zed

Build usually goes GLP>Sorc Shoes>Twin Shadows or Deathcap. If it's a tough matchup I'll go Zhonya's and sometimes Banshee's first or second item.

I wish i knew which junglers were better duelists than others.

At least it's pretty easy to tell who is a good at ganking and farming though! And you were very helpful, thanks!
As a jungle main this whole post makes me sad
I main renekton i really love the champ because, it doesnt really have much annoying top lane matches. Ganks are quete often winnable 2v1. And can carry pretty hard when getting a big lead. Plus some what easy to pick up. And in the current patch one of the strongest sidelaners with the new BORK.
The game is kinda dunny sometimes, but it should tell you what type of damage your dealing. So, in my example, it says "100(+150) PHYSICAL DAMAGE". That means both numbers deal physical damage. It should always say what type of damage is being dealt next to the numbers.

The COLOR of the texts is just what affects those numbers. Sometimes this gets a bit wonky, where you could have a strange stat, or multiple stats. For example, Senna's Q ability is kinda weird. It's a laser attack that hurts enemies and heals teammates. It's description says something like "Enemies hit take 50(+X) Physical Damage. Allied champions hit are healed for 40 (+Y)(+X) health." So, in this example, the X numbers are Orange, and the Y number is Greenish.

So, this means that it hits for 40 + a certain amount of your AD and does Physical damage. And it hits for 40 + a certain amount of your AP and AD, and it heals health. The first number is affected by levels. If the Senna's Q has 1 point in it, it'll deal the damage above. If it had 2 points, it'll deal 70(+X) damage and heal for 60(+Y)(+X) health.

Let me know if this still confuses you. I could make a short video and explain it better with visuals, if you'd like!
Okay so Poking and Trading are different for these reasons my man: Poking means you are dealing some damage to the enemy without giving them an opportunity to strike back. Not all champs can poke. Rumble can poke with his Missiles, Ezreal with his Q, Zoe with Q, etc.  Poking is one sided, and usually it's to fuck with them and wittle them down so that future trades go in your  favour. Trading is when you decide to fight for a short period of time, and you think you can outdamage your opponent. So you walk up to them, do what your champ does (with rumble you would maybe scrap shield slap them then Q to burn them and then walk away, or maybe just run at him with Q and then scrap shield to run away). Either way, trading is meant to bully the opponent into either backing or prepping them for an all-in. When you go all in to kill the opponent, it's because you know he cannot escape or win the fight. It is no longer trading unless they do some crazy shit and escape. Crazy shit includes flashing properly, out skilling you, or summoning someone to gank you. Therefore, before all-inning you should be aware of other laners, as well as when you trade. Going for a trade when you dont have knowledge of where the jungle is will often have you dead. Hope this helps.
Oh sorry I misunderstood. I enjoyed his tank capability, and his engage. If I could choose something it’d be to have more damage but still be able to engage and survive a team fight
What's your rune and build?
Yes
Honest if you're a mid main, I'd reccomend glancing the minimap after *every cs*
Pantheon sounds up your alley. Early game monster, and his ult means you can make picks even if your behind.
That’s pretty generic lol I meant more towards his kit and play style. His running engage, tank capability, etc.
Graves maybe? Basically a melee form  lucian in the jg. Lots of explosions.

I enjoyed how I could start to carry a game if I got ahead or catch up if I fell behind early
Tryndamere is a braindead champ with mobility, damage and outplay potential (i.e. other people fuck up and forget about his ult same as they do dumb shit and forget about fiora parry). He definitely fulfils the melee carry fantasy. He isn't quite as hawt as akali though.

Stab in the dark but I'm tempted to say urgot. He looks badass even if he's not gonna be your waifu, has little minigames to play when fighting, good lore, good 1 v 1, versatile. He's definitely rewarding to learn and getting good at him is actually achievable for normal humans who do other things in their lives than play soloqueue.  Not currently top tier meta but definitely more soloqueue viable than akali.
I've never had my screen locked in all the time I played from season 2. I'm trying to incorporate space bar now. Also disabling movement by clicking map is an absolute must for free cam
I like when I get ganked as a toplaner because then I can show my supreme display of skill and 1v2 them .
She's vulnerable to ganks forever because she doesn't build boots. In a pure 1v1 she's very good because she CSes well under turret, has good pushing power and can deal a lot of damage if she triggers phase rush. She scales like a god too and has incredible pressure with her flash ult combo.

Her mobility is her main weakness but her low burst is bad too. She deals good damage if she can keep spamming her E, but it takes time to get your damage out. She's also the kind of champion you need to play around because of her hypercarry nature which makes her naturally less suited to lower elo.
Not a top laner but from a midlane perspective you don’t take damage when you poke. For example a xerath hitting you with a beam from 3 maps away is a poke but him hitting you with a beam and you managing to land a ahri ball in close timing is a trade as you both took damage you traded damage. 

Now I’m not sure how it works in top but to trade or poke and avoid a all in in mid is to land your damage and avoid a key enemy ability or circumstance that allows them to all in. Example ahri charm or your just mispositioned or your hp is in their kill range. Perhaps in top avoiding any terrain ornn puts down so he can’t charge you will help.

In top minion Aggro probably plays a bigger role than in mid with tops longer fights lower burst and playing closer to minions so be careful with that and try to use it to your advantage to win trades
Zac’s really fun if you want to play jungle
What did you like/not like about Voli?
Winning your lane harder is the best thing you can do.
Just play trynd top and splitpush to victory. Iron is such a terrible place to learn the game it's unreal.
I think it's more about understanding the matchups. The rumble mains sub can help you with that.
too similiar to illaoi, but i like it
Some games just aren't winnable.
Best low elo adcs for smurfing?
What is Wukongs role in the game now? 

What is he good at, what is he bad at, what is the general condition of playing him?

When are his strong and weak points in laning etc
thank you!
I think you know this, but the way to outplay someone like that Brand is to expect he's going to use that combo if he's holding onto it. If you didn't see the Brand use the spells to that combo yet, you can be sure as hell he's gonna use it when you dash in to save his own bacon! Bait it out by using a minion to dash in, then dash out before the Q part of it hits you, then dash back in if he did in fact use Q. if he didn't, then wait for the burn from e to wear off and try again, this time hopefully dodging his w. Requires at least 2 minions but hey, can't afford to play too passively on Yasuo like you said! Gotta play around those cooldowns.
A good coach should be able to identify your weak points whatever the game is, just send them your best game. 
If he find stuffs to say in it (and realistically he should, there's always stuffs to improve on even in pro games), it means it's probably stuffs you are not even aware of, so the session will be much more useful than him telling you obvious mistakes that you already identified yourself.
Exercise and Meditation/deep breathing. Focus on your own mistakes because if you focus on others you’ll fail to see what you could do better.
Poppy is best girl, I can't be unhappy playing her. Also try her in the jg, she's actually op
I would recommend swapping jayce for Quinn, teemo or tristana unless you're super committed to him especially. Kayle is another good ranged pick with god tier lategame, but she doesn't become ranged until level 6 so you can't really lane very well until then.

Jayce has been nerfed a lot due to professional play, unless you can put in as many games as the pros do it's hard to get value out of him compared to other ranged tops.
In rocket league we tend to use games where we feel we played very well but still lost. Though lol games are very one sided
I would recommend a game you didn’t win but didn’t do terribly and your team didn’t hard feed too much so the coach can look at other things than oh that guy got hard fed so there’s not really much you could actually do
Thank you, this means a lot !
I'd recommend watching  xFSN Saber on youtube/twitch he's very educational and literally goes through match ups in a video he also mentions wave management and just decisions as adc
Thank you ! Putting things into perspective was my goal here, so I'm glad to see I've been able to achieve that.
Try to listen to film soundtracks. Or classical music if you’re into that. Just nothing with lyrics. That helps me out a lot. Because I can’t play in complete silence
You play garen, you should use conqueror instead of grasp
Kat is really good if you put the hours in. An absolute powerhouse assassin and cleanup champ, but extremely difficult to play.

I'd consider also playing a simple champ like annie so you can focus on other aspects of the game: watching the map, wave control, target selection in fights etc.
I don't know why this was downvoted so much, but that actually does kind of work?

If you stay on top of Yasuo he can't E-Q3 you directly if you just walk towards where he was when he e's you and if he's using e-q3 towards you using another minion, he always moves the exact same distance so it's somewhat predictable.

I figure most people are downvoting because that's also just asking to get autoattacked to death by Yasuo because it probably put you into a worse spot to dodge the e-q, so you better be ready to all-in or have an escape plan.
what does the blue energy thing that sejuani gives to her teammates do
nah it was caitlyn, and we knew she was a challenger player after she spammed her emote so when we managed to chunk her low we took our chance and tried to dive her, but she had some crazy ass mechanics and managed to double kill us and it was just gg after that nobody could touch her the rest of the game
Darius is a relatively simple bully who trashes most melees in lane and teamfights and uses mana not energy but is a frequent pick/ban and gets pretty hard countered by ranged champs.

Illaoi is very similar to Darius but slightly harder to execute. She's less frequently banned though.

Kled is a more difficult champ but certainly has bully potential and is less frequently picked.

Pantheon is another strong early laner with excellent roam potential but he falls off pretty hard later in the game.

Ranged toplaners like kennen, quinn and teemo are very strong at bullying opponents early in lane but often struggle out of lane.
use ur worst game
>Yeah half this game ~~in low elo~~ is psychological.

FTFY
Contrary to popular belief, top lane makes a huge difference in the game. If you win lane u can easily create 4v5s and win team fights as well as split push and get the rest of your team ahead
Gotta agree. Even when I feel like Im playing at my absolute best, 8 ish cs/min is usually the best I can do, which usually falls to around 7 cs/min later.

At this point I use 10 cs/min as a measuring tool: How's my kda looking? If its good, do I have around 6-7 cs/min? If not then Im probably not as strong as I look and should still play kinda reserved. If my kda looks mediocre or kinda bad but Im chillin at 8+ cs/min, Im deceptively strong amd can still claw my way back up. Things like that
IMO, mobility. If the enemy dodges your poison stuff, you don‘t deal damage. Also her early. Cass without Tear doesn‘t have the mana to kill. And her lvl 1 is Alister level weak, it‘s usually just E to farm.
ye thats why it's so easy to climb in top lane playing any champion, like useless support champs. You can win purely by sitting in lane and taking down all the towers, going 0/0/0, while the other 9 players mess around in the middle of the map.

How to farm minions well? Also, how to ping?
An on hit build using her pix damage would be good to cut through tanks.

Blade of the ruined king, nashors tooth, rageblade should help you cut through them. BoRK also has a slow to help kite.

Wits end Vs magic damage or as a 4th on hit item.
I'm highly skeptical, It may be that I have an overly conservative playstyle but I don't go into fights that I see domed from the beginning.    
There are cases in which 4v5 makes sense: if the others expended resources already, have low hp/can easily one-shot one or two enemy champions.    
But I'm not going into fights that I consider doomed, i prefer 250gp worth of CS over giving the enemy 300 gold (or more).
no. adc is currently the only role that is onshotted by all the other roles. if you have 20 kills at 20 minutes, you will still die to a single combo or even a single ability from most top, mid and junglers. carrying game without ever getting comboed a single time is pretty much impossible. You can definetly influence the game, but you cant carry a bad team. Look at it this way, if you are twice as good as the other people in the game you can carry, if you are 20% better you are insignificant pretty much regardless of gold and you will not be able to carry.
Also she has no escapes, so certain junglers like J4 can make her life hell in lane.
Viktor is a good pick against her. You scale very well like her but you’re a much better team fighter. You have massive burst late game if she gets too close and you can just endlessly shove if you’re not confident you can win lane.
Yeah pretty much every jungle main will make you the primary target the second someone starts complaining in all chat about getting yanked too much.

If you’re getting ganked all day, and it’s not turret dives, then 99% of the time it’s because you’re always pushed up with no wards.

Foxdrop and Iwilldominate have great jungle content some of its a bit old depending on the video but the core knowledge is the same. How to dominate series by Dom and then just pick any video of a champ you play by Foxdrop

Don't be put off by the click bait titles they're both good content
Go get em boi, you got this. Remember to have fun tho, and don't feel bad for lol. It's just a game.

If you see it as a game and not as "I must absolutely improve faster than ever" you will improve faster.
GP is not good to climb out of low elo. Unless you are able to carry and have really good mechanics, you should be using more simple champs like sett, morde, trynd.
I was already aware of this " trinity" but reading your post really helped me put it more into perspective, I'll pay more attention to it next time I play. Whether as jungle or laner. Thank you! 

I want to add something to those who are reading, if you're in a lane, and your jungle is close to you, keep an eye on him to help him out if you can.
If he gets jumped on in his own jungle you should help him if possible because you might save him and take a kill, or trade kills if he dies nonetheless.

 If your jungler is in the enemy jungle and you have lane priority, try to help him too for the same reasons. It really will make his job easier and you might score some "easy" kills. Win-win situation.
Thank u. Are u NA? Wanna help/ coach me?
In the settings somewhere is a place you can turn on/off team chat and all chat. Turn those off. Not only does it mute everyone right away (but still keeping pings on) but it also doesn’t allow you to type. 

I would often mute everyone early on but still type and try to let people know what we could have done differently to win that fight or what to focus. I think in the years of trying that approach inevitably I found and most have said before that typing just really isn’t worthwhile at all. You never know the simplest thing that could set someone off. 

Now instead you are less likely to poke at someone and you never know how someone will react to what you type. You can communicate solely with pings and you really need nothing more. 

I also was in a huge losing streak somewhat recently and I watched this video comparing poker and lol and I found it hugely beneficial to my mental. 

[Shout out to Neace for this great video](https://youtu.be/TB4y-qk7V78)
Don't TP if you're behind coz you risk losing your lane too and especially don't if enemy is pushing you in or has tp too.
Try porofessor desktop add on. Can bring it up in game and it shows you champ info.
I dominate every single game and only lose if I have 3-4 monkeys who run down 5 deaths + in first 10 minutes. I still only have a 65-70% win rate. 

If you’re losing your own lane you can’t climb. Just play for fun and to learn. Can still play ranked. You’ll land in a rank suited for you and can practice there.
I don‘t think a splitpush comboing champ like GP is a good pick for Iron. Play something simple, oppressive, and easy to snowball like Tryn or Darius.
Is /mute all still muting pings?
As a tank what do I build against Vayne?
Korean open mid games pull down the average
There’s a difference between just saying 10 cs/min compared to saying 10 cs/min at 10 mins. No one, and I repeat **no one** who parrots the 10cs/min “tip” actually mentions @10mins. How are new players supposed to automatically understand that they specifically mean early game?
The adcs complaining about getting oneshot are those with poor knowledge of their role and the game itself
Yeah I guess you’re right.., I have his mechanics down well and he’s so fun to play, but there’s been a lot of games lately where I can’t keep up with the early game pressure a Vi, Voli or Olaf puts up as they spam gank, and I know by ten min when I have no kills and the enemy team has a collective 12 then we won’t win.

But I don’t want to give up on him and really don’t want to give in to playing some wack champs like Yi or Nunu.

Graves I had better luck with because he has some better early gank potential, albeit not great with no CC, but he’s actually who I got to 70% WR with and started crashes when I was getting lanes going 0/13 all the way until I demoted 

Idk what to do and honestly it was so frustrating I considered quitting the game because it seemed to flawed that I could consistently play better than my team and most people on the enemy team but if I didn’t pick certain champs then it doesn’t matter.  Can’t trust these people not to totally feed minutes into the game.  I get it happens but I couldn’t believe kt was happening for like 7 straight games
I started with a locked cam too (back in s5) in the middle of s6 I switched to the unlocked option. In my opinion it is the best decision you can make in you league carreer. One thing you have to learn is, to use your space key. It will center the free camera back onto your champion.

Anotherthing is the use of your minimap. The minimap is a great way to move your camera from point A to point B.

You can also use your F keys (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5) to move your camera too allies. However I find this to be a very advanced technique to move your camera.

Concluding I would recommend that you just play with a free camera. You most certanly will get used too it.

Hope i could help.
Goos stuff here
True, but I don't have abilities at Level 1, and my AA range on sniper is still much shorter than most poke abilities form enemy laners. (Lux E, Caitlyn Q, etc.) How do I get around that?
NA
It doesnt stop at low elo
I am looking for some champion recommendations for top lane.

I would like to pick up a lane bully, I can win lane most of the time with. I like Renektons strong early and mid game but I dont really like his kit and the rage management... 

do you all have any ideas?
Theae things come with experience. Play champions that you like amd start with the recommended builds. You will eventually learn the items
I've read what I wrote on my post and it does sound like I feel like a God whoops xD. What I was tryn to say is that I was proud of my Diana but I didn't mention how I know that it's a champion that (at I least I feel like) doesn't involve that much skill just some micro mechanics, in fact my point was that I couldn't impact much my games because I feel useless after laning phase as I couldn't roam and be actually useful. I honestly don't have time to watch other people streams and I don't have the urge to rank, if that's what I deserve it's fine to me. Thanks for your help appreciated ;)
I usually play the other game types like Aram or just do random bot games to see if a player jives with my play style or they just make sense to me. There’s some champs that when I play I’m like a chicken with his head cutoff.

If they feel comfortable I’ll then try them out in normals and see how I do there.

Garen is pretty easy. I typically pick him and if he is banned I’ll go Darius, if they are both banned then I just  laugh and try to have fun with fiora
That match especially that I should have won lane and I was forced out of lane super hard
500000 AP viegar with lichbane or a 10million health chogath will always stomp everything
As far as specific matchups, adcs fall into a few categories: there’s Bursty boys like jhin, MF, draven who want to do super short trades and back off, there’s lane bullies like Lucian and kaisa who let their support engage or for you to slip up and then drop a full combo, there’s utility champs like sivir, jinx, and Ashe who just want to power farm through lane phase and get straight to team fights because their kit is better suited for it, and there’s poke champs like caitlyn who abuse range. 
The issue with starting as Aphe is he’s TOO versatile, meaning it’ll be harder for you to get a sense of your preferred playstyle because he’s sort of a jack of all trades. The advantages of him is that you’ll learn the ins and outs of adjusting your playstyle and build depending on matchup.
As far as recommendations if you’re still learning the basics of adc, I’d start with jinx or Ashe. They’re both easy and pretty fun to play, and due to their kit even if you don’t do well during laning phase you can still be super impactful later.

Also I left out hypercarries, because they don’t really fit into the meta right now, like another post said ADC is super weak right now so getting them fed is never a win con. These are champs like kogmaw and a couple others who you never see in games and prolly won’t for a while lmao.

Good luck!
Got it, took notes and now I'll jump into a match. I'll upload a video in a while as you said. Ty very much :)
Ok, I see now, the difference is pretty significant, if not indeed huge.

Yep i feel like my macros much better than my micro for sure. Started playing about 6 months ago n mostly aram but watched alot of improvement videos. Ty for the pep talk fren
Turn. Chat. Off. 

Best advice I can give.
If you get out played by iron mid laners you probably need to focus more on your basic mechanics. You can win as a support, good thing because that means you have some macro down. You are halfway there.

Assassins are counters to immobile mages, this doesn't mean a mage can't win into an assassin. 

Mechanics boi. CS, trading, lane management, important wards, dodging, managing cooldowns and mana. You will outclass them.
Sona, she is one of the most mana hungry champs in the game. Plus she doesn't scale up much in survivability through the game stages, so the shield is a life saver.

Plus the way her auras work now makes the gains from tear more useful.
Lmao ikr tips these days. Jeez

As someone who is very bad mechanically and am trying to climb as an ADC (started B4, in promos for G4) play ADC’s that can impact the game without being fed. Ashe is the perfect champ for me since she has impact regardless of my kills.

Another thing I’ve seen touted on here is that since ADC is such a weak role right now, the best way you can contribute is simply by not feeding. I often end games with 4 or so kills with only a couple deaths, but will come out with 15-16 assists. 

Some champs in the bot lane are inherently built as hyper carries and will struggle without kills or a team built around them (Kog, Jinx), so be smart about comp. 

With solo q it’s also important to know who your support is and what he’s capable of. I usually like to get a feel for how passive/aggressive my supp is before I commit to being more aggressive or passive. For example, if I have a morg that’s not very accurate with her bind, I’ll usually play more passively to encourage her not to aggro. You’ll have a much more successful lane if you’re on the same page with the support.
Play all the popular ABC's. And make sure to play not broken one right now. This will help you learn other champs, who is more bursty, or more sustained. Some hit their power spike early, others late. If you get yours early, add tons of pressure without opening yourself up for gank. Watch dragon first and foremost, as your job as an adc is less roaming than mid. Help your jungler when you can. 
A lot of being adc is prepping for those big team fights down the line.
Tbh i tried velkoz mid but get out played by yas n kat n leblancs anyone with a dash can out play me pretty much. But in sup we always dominate lane due to the excessive poke and even if we dont i can scale but again.. the hard ints -.- struggling if i wanna keep playing solo lol. So frustrating
Know the value of trades.

Like if you roam here, what would I lose vs. what would I gain.

How many minions, plates, how likely is my rotation to work, what do we get out of it, etc.

That's really, really important and the base of pretty much everything you are doing in League, down to trades in lane and macro. If you don'T understand value and can't think ahead in 30 second increments it will hurt your play.

A big reason why even in D4 the game feels very coinflippy, since players still play more like a fighting game and not the moba.

As tanks you want to be there for your team and esp. for objectives, like Drake. Again, what do you lose vs. what do you gain.

And how can you create a trade that is worth it ?

Like recalling to have items for when you would be at drake.

Pushing out the wave so you can make it to drake in time.

Rotating on a Canonwave.

One thing you also can do is get your mid and jungler fed.

Top has downtimes where you can rotate mid for almost free or lossing like a melee minion and a canon, while still cathing the canon exp. Or deepward their jungle which can lead to other stuff. I mean, if your bot knows, oh their jungler is on krugs or you ping that out that's a help for everybody. Doesn't mean as much in Plat or something, but it's not useless.

As top bot is obviously far away.

But about the time you have more freedem top it's midgame and midgame is where midlaners are more in the spotlight.

Oris get their Ludens + Double Pen and ADCs still don't have their items a lotta of the time.

And it can feel pretty annoying as a botlaner to play vs. midpressure. Cause they can roam on you, they can murder you real quick if they arent played around.

Saving TP bot is also good.

But like I said, the Trade.

It also helps a loooot to know how strong your team actually is.

Like what items are up, what sums are up.

If you TP you into DRaven with BT and your Vayne is sitting at Vamp Scepter + Daggers lol you need some other advantrage to make that TP work most likely. They are chunked, he doesn#T have flash, he is overextended, mid is coming too, he is alone...

Also mute chat and optimize what you can do.

And if you can think ahead, you can also work on another issue which is overstaying a rotation or a tp instead of realizing when you have to go back to lane. 

There are times when you can'T stay for plates or literally have to give up on a play and not brute force it. Cuase if oyu fail AND die AND you used TP that's much worse then just losing TP and one wave.
There isn’t much of a skill different between divisions until you get way up the ladder. You will start noticing a gap in high vs low gold in that tier. But the difference between bronze 2 vs 3 is negligible, but the different between d1 and D2 might be pretty big and the gap between high and low diamond will be really big.

Also I am smurfing in rengar in silver and I can say he is a pretty hard champion to play well. His cleats are rough, his itemization is expensive and he requires a snowball to hard carry.

Pathing is also super important. I just started to be “ok” on him after about 100 games in my smurf with him. Granted I don’t jungle, but I can easily get to gold on other simpler junglers.

Jungling with him is a combination of learning how to play him and learning how to jungle efficiently.

If I had to guess you probably are really inconsistent with him and going 1-1-2 or something by 10 minutes is not going to translate to wins on him. Basically, if you aren’t 3-0 by ten minutes on rengar then you might as well play another jungler. He scales well, but his carry potential is from snowballing
I don't think it's the case for every game,+ farm is the most reliable and consistent thing in the game
If you play as a duo supp adc it's even better. You can go mid, your buddy can stay adc, you have the two most important lanes covered. In iron ganks are utterly inexistent, place a pair of wards and play on the warded side of the lane (if mid). 

Velkoz is an insanely strong carry too.
ryze anivia kassadin cassiopeia ezreal
Tower diving is the big one, since they can literally hide behind (or should I say "under") the tower and be unclickable if you don't use it.

Also if the enemy jungler jumps in to dragon/baron pit to try to steal and you want to stop hitting the dragon/baron while you kill the jungler.

But personally, I use it every single time I'm fighting someone who has minions nearby.
Best and only description of this kind I have seen. Thanks.
Not judging but sounds like an excuse to me smh
Half the time adc ints the othet half the jungle ints. I dont mind if people are bad but purposely inting is so prevalent in iron its sad.. i play as a duo and we win like 70 percent rhen play solo sup n lose 70 percent lol
If you can't win this matchup you should probably find a new champion. Teemo into Nasus is one of the most one-sided matchups ever.
Whatever you do avoid morgana. Alot of people who are new pick up morgana see how easy she is and then flatbed there learning as they spam as and steal kills with w.
Thank you, this version looks much better.
In what scenario would I get the most benefit from using the 'attack champions only' toggle? I've heard it's important, but it also doesn't work while using the attack move command, so I would have to right click on the champion, correct? I just feel like accidentally issuing a move command is worse than accidentally attacking a minion, so maybe I'm missing something here?
I know it's not a good thing to say, but don't play support in iron. If you like Vel koz go play him mid. Supporting in iron is tilting and hard as fuck. 

Stop your support career in iron, go mid with your favourite champ, and go back to support in high bronze. Still hard but a lot better.

After playing mid you will have a better knowledge of the game and be stronger even in your role.

And carrying games as a support in iron is almost impossible.

Or steal farm from the carry and do the hard work yourself
You know you're doing well when someone shits on you for giving *too good* advice.
What is it about thresh you like? He is a very versatile champion with a lot of ways of playing

And yet twice today, I had games playing top where I won the matchup if it was even, but lose hard if behind, got ganked, and jungler is nowhere to be found for the rest of the lane.  Matchups that are good only based on kill pressure are kinda rough sometimes.
Gnar is not an easy champion to play. He's ranged but has a low aa range, you need to manage your rage bar to make TP plays and he's not easy to play in teamfights if you're rage bar is not full.

Plus Irelia is so strong atm and she destroys Gnar in little form. People saying Gnar is easy have no idea what they're talking about and just giving you bad advice. If you wanna learn the champion, go ahead, but if you want to learn toplane, there are better alternatives.
IIRC the only CC that can't be reduced or removed is knock up. The thing with suppression od that cleanse doesnt work
That's almost enough that you have an accurate measure of your winrate. What is your current winrate?
Heal was still the meta back then and using exhaust was still looked down upon
No its not lol. Look at LCS or Worlds matches, they all have 12+cs per min but the jgler and the support
20
Jackspektra is pretty good.
having <1 second to react isn't something uncommon for adc players. And while it's true that it won't work against champions like Shaco or Talon, it's very well doable to exhaust something like Rengar mid air jumping on you.

The thing is, that heal wouldn't safe you either, because every assassin overkills you anyways. But having a chance to outplay them with exhaust, even if it works only half the time, is a god sent.
Ok ty. I don't play Draven so this is news to me. Good information!
No everyone starts at around silver-ish MMR when they first begin placements.
Tell me about it. If I weren't 800k mastery into this shit role I'd be switching to tanks. 😒
>n ranked or get carried. Sometimes when my support is good I can also play good but thats quite rare. This situation is quite the opposite when I play normal games. I do most of the damage and I end with most cs. I feel like when I play ranked all the other players are better than me. I can also see this in the loading screen. Other players are all like 100+ level, which leads them killing me a

This. In one of my promos I was playing with a 1 million mastery points yi. I thought damn nice free win. Press tab 15 minutes in the game Yi is 0/9 calling for a ff.
I think the other guy has typed enough about roaming and timings so I'm not going to repeat his points. Especially read the part about your CS because I'm pretty sure you're just not thinking after laning phase and playing ARAM with your team when there are 2 other lanes + a jungle.

I've coached a couple of bronze/silver friends and my first piece of advice to low elo players is always to keep your ego low. You're not a "70% winrate Diana" who "loses lane twice in a fuckton of games". There's no "bot diff every game". You don't have "Diana skills". If there are players that can hit diamond with 80% winrate, there is absolutely no reason for you to think about yourself highly with your stats at your rank.

You're bronze 4 with a negative winrate. It's good that you admitted your mistakes in roaming and timings being bad, but the way you type still shows unnecessary ego. Sounds harsh but you need to start viewing shit from your perspective. Blame yourself always. Even if enemy ADC is 10-0 at 10 minutes, could you have at least played lane phase such that you could've come out with +1 kill, or +20 cs, or -1 death?

Watch streams of pro players that play mid like Faker. When are they roaming? How do they move around lanes after towers die? How do they play if their opponent is the one roaming? Look at people at the top of the game and ask yourself what you would be doing in their position, then watch what they do and how it compares to your decision. Decision making is something that you can absolutely learn and is the main thing holding back people at pretty much every rank.
A combination of map awareness, disciplined "safe facechecking"(with abilities for example), and decent macro knowledge should get you in a position where you can tell which area is safe and which isn't. General answer to a general question :/
Did you read my comment? Tbh seems to me, like you didn't.
i like to spam shit talk to make the enemy jungler appear. as Illaoi, I'm very happy to invite him to sit top as long as he wants

Stay with Thresh. He really does it all. But play proactive whenever you can.
You go into practice game dont buy any items so its harder to cs and just farm 20 minutes and try to miss as little as possible.
Morde is a 1v9 champion. If you play it right you can take over a game with one early kill. Not to mention he tanky AF so you're less likely to feed shutdowns later. 

For that reason I would favor him for solo q over a champion that requires team coordination like Anivia.
Not to be a dick or that guy but most of this is actually kind of obvious stuff, I mean what else is a jungler for? (someone that just farms and secures objectives? no.)
Solo kills matter, even if you evened them out later. You could've punished Viktor way harder esp since early solo kills give him access to his waveclear that much faster.


Also, there's no reason to walk up and trade autos with Viktor early on. He's running electrocute and even though you have bone plating, his Q shield + electrocute will pretty much outtrade you every time. Also ignite vs TP.



I would suggest going straight void staff in this game instead of Morellos. Realistically its only Kalista with decent healing as Senna's heal is pretty long cd. You can already 1 shot Kalista with how fed you are so heal reduction is not as important.

22:00 Not much to say but this death costs your team a lot. 


I think you played fine overall but you could have carried if you played a little better.
Yup that is what started her coming back to the meta, then new conq came in and made her absurd
Cause he's not an early game bully anymore in this meta? Lmao. 

[Also, here's a link to my other comment explaining why the Manamune build is better now. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Draven/comments/fnluvb/-/flebujo)

No Draven main should build Crit nowadays.
10 cs/min or even 7-8 is almost impossible in low elo. Counting the amount you miss, if you stay at lane, you will be 1/0/0 with ~ 170 farm at 20, while your roaming enemy laner comes back with 120 or even lower, but like 6/2/4, red buff, and 2-3 dragon buff due to constant teamfighting/skirmishes.
Many times, especially on mid, after level 6-9 its teamfight/roaming all they, with sometimes a wave in. Almost all the time I look at minimap and could do much better going to bot/take enemy blue/take dragon then farming one lane with aa and 1 ability.

Edit: edited a bit.
i don't know where it comes from really, that kind of mindset. it's mostly about analyzing matchups, my last game i noticed i had a full ad team, i was last pick, so i picked zyra. well guess what? none of the enemies had any mr items and i blew up everyone. if i was with a tank, pretty sure the vayne would leave me alone when i engaged the caitlyn because its just the kind of player he was, he was farming a blue buff with baron up while me and kled fighted for vision on baronside. yes, as vayne. and the red was up topside so he could have just gone for the red. basically rn the only way ill risk a leona/naut is if i see a senna support b/c it is hilarious to bully her, and i know she will die when i engage with minimal effort from the adc, otherwise, im just not risking it. i know some main ad's that will only perform well with tanks thought, so there's that, but when you have a duo it's different. soloq is soloq. i guess if you only play tanks its fine, the dude twas against me is a mono maokaii support and he was doing ok with it, but for me it doesn't work on soloq.
Legit my exact thought after reading this. Now average low elo players will think its not so bad to have 120 cs at 20 mins. Its so easy to win low elo with just some wave management and farming skills. When i smurf i go top irelia get 9cs/min and 1v9 the game. You can actually win the game by just csing really efficiently and playing good carry champs. And Im not even that good on top lane and dont know half the matchups, just the diamond level wave management and csing skills let me easily win, if I was better on top I could even go for 10-11cs/min and snowball even harder.
Wait, really? Why would an early game lane bully want an item that's not gold efficient for 20 minutes? Please explain.
I don't say he buy qss everytime yes legend tenacity and mercs is enough but there's special case like Malzahar, Skarner and Warwick suppression. Those can't be reduced by tenacity

Its been over a week since you grinded last, and you played a ton of ARAM and OFA in between. Is it possible you're just rusty?

I notice my mechanics slipping if I don't play just for day, let alone a week.
Well if youre a melee champion and youre in effective range youre not really running away anymore. And yeah the best neutral camps to use for this purpose are drake and krugs, maybe wolves.

However I was imagining a scenario where youre being chased but youre not in range to fight, so you hit the camps and the enemy takes aggro, loses ms and all that jazz.
CS is one of the few consistent metrics that increases with rank. 

Good CSing and sidelane management was one of the biggest reasons for me climbing. Its free gold. Who cares about the ARAM mid. Go to a sidelane and farm.

I will forever preach about maximizing CS. I dont want to hear excuses about lower MMRs playing differently and having to tailor your playstyle accordingly. Your lane opponent will roam at bad times; the enemy team will let you take T2 side tower for free; you wont be punished as much in lane, etc. 

If you are playing correctly, there is no way you shouldnt have a massive gold/xp advantage through virtue of farming.

Sure 10 cs a min is a bit extreme, but 8 or 9 is a reasonable goal.
Abuse her shitty mana pool early and/or pick champs that outrange her. 

LS has said before she's exceptionally good if you're playing a champ has to come to her i.e. a non tank melee. Something like velkoz (or equivalent) destroys her.

Part of the reason her winrate is so high is all her counters are very unpopular.
if you're Jhin and you have crit...yes, lol.

if you are JG and you can spare a smite to heal yourself, maybe.

Anyone else? No, not a good idea.

(Though I definitely steal Red Buff on my way out as ADC all the time. Its just too tempting!)

EDIT: On second thought, if you have life steal then its also not a terrible idea, assuming its just a drive by. More health is more health.
Kass doesn’t actually like to get a tear. He can but it hurts his power spike. Better to just go lost chapter straight into seraphs because backing for tear sets back seraphs a bit too much. That or RoA.
Welp that is me as an adc. 170 cs in 20 min. I believe I am strong with my cs lead. Then 60 cs enemy nunu rolls his giant snowball to my lane presses 2 buttons if I don't have flash I die.
Before roaming push your wave to the enemy turret. Don't roam for too long or you lose cs to your turret. You impact the game by drawing pressure to your own lane through pushing, which relieves pressure from your other lanes. Or you rotate/gank and help jungle or side lanes.

Learn to trade, when to cs, and how to position yourself. There are some very useful youtube videos both with cookie cutter examples on how to do this and also many coaching videos of every day players on specific champions. These two points will help you win lane and impact the game.

You have 5cspm at 10 minutes but you essentially stop farming altogether past 20 minutes. You are playing mid lane so it's understandable to a certain extent but I'm not sure about struggling for 3 digit cs by almost 30 minutes. This seems to be a trend with your matches that extend past 20 minutes, both wins and losses, but doesn't seem to be something you struggle with when you play ADC.

Play another 100 games of Diana over the next month or so, record a match and upload it to Youtube and post it so you can get a more tailored review of your skill. A win rate over 13 games doesn't say much about your ability with a champion.

Good luck out there!
Play shen Kled or panth. But seriously you have to snowball your lane hard if you want to be able to make an impact bot because you need to either tp with wave shoved in or walk bot and tp to top, the latter of which is much riskier if not on the latter two champs.
I play Swain support generally when I get put in that position, Vlad and Urgot are my top laners. And yeah, just shows how shit I am if I can't trade with urgot lol

And I do read up on what I need to do but my mechanics are the worst of any player, even those in Iron IV
I didn't consider out of combat mobility, but even then in most cases you should just hit the enemy with some damage - not a camp (if you are totally melee then you probably don't want to walk over to a camp to hit it either).

Creep block is not at all reliable on any of the camps, and basically can't be done at red buff and gromp. 

The only situation I can think of that attacking a camp would be a good choice is if you were being chased by someone like Rammus.
Don’t play swain but he’s not a typical top lander moreso in this meta but you go for bursts not extended trades. Vlad you do trade you out sustain everything you get an empowered Q go for it then back off you should never be all-ing with vlad pre-6. If you already getting jumped on Q and walk away. Vlad is so weak without items in the early game. Not being able to trade with urgot is alarming since he has good trade potential. Again mechanics are failing you here and likely knowledge on matchups. If you are constantly trying to all in every fight then that’s already a mistake.
Idk why people downvote you, if we talk about high elo and we are talking about split pushers you definitely can aim and should aim for more than 10cs/min. The thing with aim is it doesnt mean you must reach it everygame it means that in perfect game or scenario you could get it. So a snowballing high elo Irelia or tryndamere can easily get above 10cs/min. Whats the point of aiming for 8cs/min? Even people in low diamond can easily average 8cs/min you should aim for higher than what you easily get every game. I can even link where a d4 tryndamere got 10cs/min in a game that he lost.
I recently climbed out of Iron. I'm by no means a particularly good player so I see no reason you shouldn't be able to do it too. 

Thinking back I think it mostly came down to laning. I played a champion that wins lane very easily and spikes hard off of one kill. There are lots of champions that snowball but aren't dedicated split pushers. Sett, Darius, Garen, Mordekaiser, Illaoi, ECT.

People in Iron are constantly mispositioning so getting that first kill is pretty easy, usually I just did as much unreturned damage level 1 as I could then all in them at level 2. If you kill minions faster than them you will be able to fight them when they are still 1 but you are 2. Very reliable kills that way.

Once that's done you push wave, recall for items, walk back to preserve your TP and freeze wave by tower. Congrats, the enemy toplane is now your bitch. Every time they try to cs you trade aggressively. Iron players have no idea how to deal with aggression they either int or totally concede the lane.

At that point you chill and look for opportunities to TP botlane. Don't be afraid to ask your bot lane to drop a ward in the alcove for you to TP to. Winning means getting everyone ahead, not just farming your lane for 30 minutes.

This is where scaling picks like GP run into trouble. By the time you are strong and ready to fight the game has already been decided by other people.

In low elo you can't wait around and expect your teammates to not int. If they could do that they wouldn't be in Iron. Instead you have to be the one proactively making things happen and showing them how to win.

Its a flow chart. Win lane, take Rift, take dragon, get outer towers, dragon and Rift again, then take control of enemy jungle and clear camps to deny them XP, patiently set up for Baron and widen the gold difference, wait for picks then break the nexus.

Winning is a process, and the more you familiarize yourself with the process the simpler the game becomes. Because Iron is so chaotic, just coming in with a plan and guiding your team through the flow will help immensely. 

These players don't know how to win, they don't know there is a procedure. If you lay it out for them with pings you will usually get at least one or two (if you're lucky) who will follow your lead.
It should be noted that Irelia probably has the highest CS among all champs not only cause she split pushes, but because even in teamfights she "farms" because Q rests are so essential to her kit and minions are easy targets for mobility
why not
Urgot, Swain and Vlad are my most played, and I want to learn Darius but with my trading being shit its not been a fun experience so far
Then that is simply your mechanics taking its toll. If you’re unable to translate your knowledge into mechanics then it’s a loss. Work on your mechanics in the practice tool. Read up and practice combos on the test dummies until you can execute the combo with ease. Cant do much with any champ if you can’t even utilize them properly.
Another note what champ do you even play.
CS is not exactly the same thing as gold income. Fundamentally, CS, aka **creep score** is a measure of how many **creeps** (i.e. minions and monsters) you've killed. This is why CS/min and gold/min are separate metrics, as the two are related but not directly correspondent.
You can creep block, disable mobis and other off combat mobility boosts as well as skills. Just use your brain, there are situations when you should do this and when you shouldnt. But the main reason is not because theyll be too tempted to take the camp.
I do generally, but I struggle to translate it into my gameplay, and my lack of confidence to exploit a champions strength is so often taken advantage of by my lane opponent and I lose
It’s more so understanding the matchup like are you on a champ that excels in long trades vs one that goes for quick ones or the other way around. Are you primarily a heavy AA champ or a skill base one where you want to get a rotation on your spells. Just read up on what your champ excels at, it’s counters and what you counter.
The general idea is if you play enough games your skill will take you to the rank you deserve that said, when you are a low rank like iron you have so much to personally improve about your gameplay which will rapidly make you climb. When it comes to what champ it doesnt matter too much when you are low rank, i wouldnt recommend a splitpusher like trynda tho because your team wont know how to play with it. You could find more success with a champ that have an earlier powerspike since most games are decided rather quick. Last thing - play to improve not to win, mute all if it helps you focus on the game.
Anivia is harder and more rewarding. Morde is probably better into your average soloqueue player who plays yasuo, Diana and talon
I'd be keen to make miss fortune passive cost 1 Mana or something. Would make her a great manamune user
Hello there,

I just climbed out of iron, taking around 300 games to get into low gold elo right now, and there's a few things I notice Iron players do wrong.

1. Warding, iron players don't realize the importance of vision, if you're winning lane as a gangplank top, you need to not only focus on killing your enemy laner, but also helping out as much as you can. Drop wards deep into the enemy jungle, help your jungler invade, and as much as possible put pressure on your enemy to react to you.
2. Teleport, teleport is one of the most impactful summoner spells if played correctly. Always be on the lookout for possible teleport ganks, does your bot look like it will be dived soon? Can you teleport to an existing fight to turn it around? These things can help your other lanes snowball as well.
3. Item builds, are you building the correct items? Why are you getting one shot by an enemy if you've won your lane? Maybe you're building too much damage when you need a little more survivability. Maybe you need something that can help you chase down people faster instead of just pure raw damage.
4. Communication, pings, if your teammates are running around messily, try to ping them to important objectives. Remember, your teammates are people too, they're not robots, oftentimes people will listen to you if you ping and communicate- especially if you're ahead.
How many games have you played?
Yeah pretty much what the other guy said, it’s not gonna work against competent players. I guess you could conceivably block skill shots by aggroing camps with a no cast time ability but the chances of that working are low.
No this is a terrible idea unless you can either heal off the camp, or make use of some sort of monster mechanic like dragon takeoff to get away. Nobody (unless they were giving up the chase anyway) would let you go in order to take a jungle camp, instead you're wasting time that you could be using to run away, to path and attack a jungle camp.

The only exception to this rule is raptors, where if you're being chased through the bush - you might be able to attack the camp as a *ranged champion* and if you're very lucky, you can creep block whoever is chasing you inside that bush for a short period of time.
Glad I could help!
Pretty sure they changed the W so there is no minimum range on the W. Could be wrong but pretty sure it's changed. I do agree she does have high mana costs early as far as trading goes
Wow wtf

Have a look at my last game. The one i went 0/5 i kinda soft inted out of tilt because i had 2 afk, so that was on me. The Last one i don't know what i should have done better.

I know i messed up early on when Viktor solo killed me, but it didn't even matter as i was able to tp back and get him and made him miss a huge wave. After the first two deaths (which didn't cost the game at all) i think i played fine.
I don't understand that either.
Here’s the thing, in real games (5v5) they all reach this tier. In soloq they get ~9 per min while smurfing and ~8 while on their main. It’s still a big difference if you are in Platin or diamond and enemies don’t even know they can stop you from csing and you have a bad cs score without contest or you have a meh score like 8 against people who are trying to deny everything they can.
5 or 6 a wave is enough. What you really need to focus on is surving lane, getting plates and hitting enemies when they least expect it.
As an iron 3/4 velkos support.. i wait for the answers
Back when graves was one of the strongest adc of the game ahah
Some challenger players are testing it out. Not super popular right now.
Post op.gg so we can spectate some games. I am sitting in 30 min queues so I'll look at a game.
Low range and limited teamfight options. You will pretty much always fight front to back apart from the occasional flash ult. She's good at what she does, but there are a lot of teamcomps that make it difficult to put out damage reliably e.g. J4+Rumble+Standard botlane.


As for how to play against her, you can either dodge all Qs or pick something that outranges her or has good mobility.
My experience is similar. It's hard to force a big enough advantage in the 2v2, and a good amount of games you are doomed to 2v4 under tower anyway. Naut and Leona are fine and all, not bad picks by any means, but it's pretty weird how some people here who don't even like playing them cry about how they *have* to play "tank supports". Like no dude, most of us play other champions and do at least as well.
Another tip that works well for me - if someone locks in Yasuo into your lane, pick Renekton. I've played that matchup in gold elo like 10 times this season, and I've never lost that lane. Since level 3, Renekton with PTA jist totally shits on Yasuo
Anivia is my main and she’s enjoyable because there’s few true counters to her. You can also either just clear waves and have a chill game or try to bait the other team with your egg. It might not seem like it but you can def outplay people with her in numerous ways
100 at 10 means you got 100/107 possible CS, 200 at 22 means you got 200/253 (number here might be slightly off, I'm doing this in my head). Meaning, first one is near perfect CS, latter is missing like 20% of CS.
> When and how do i roam to the best of my abilities with the abilities i have? 

Honestly, whenever you feel like you can get kill, especially with your ult up. Ditching wave if you can get kills isnt that bad, especially if you can get yourself/your team ahead + make enemy team tilt and blame their mid.

> How do i keep up with items with such low clear speed? 

Idk what are your starting items, I really like long sword + 3 pots, you are closer to tiamat and your passive + pots make you unpokeable. Then farming shouldnt be that much of a problem.

> How do i handle getting bullied by champs in lane (ESP ranged)? 

Your best bet is to play smartly around that. Do I need to go for this caster minion when Ill get poked? Probably not. I like trying to bait out enemies aas while hovering closely around my wave so they get attacked by my minions.

> How do i explain to my team that they should suck it up and give me the kill 

You dont, they wouldnt probably understand anyway. You probably know that, but you dont need to kill, its enough if enemies were in your ult when they died, its nice way to get your team ahead as well, not only yourself.

I personally love mid Pyke, but honestly, Talon is just better, especially for learning to roam.
Pressure her early. Cassio uses a lot of mana since her wave-clearing without abilities isnt really good. Let her clear a little, keep your distance and start pressuring.
Move a lot too. Evading skills is important, but even more with cassio's Q (green poison) and W(purple arc) . The poison isnt really that bad in early game, but it can become a problem once she has her E(missile fangs) . 
Remember that W has a mininum range, so dont be afraid of getting near IF the Q is out. Getting near with Q means trouble cause you wont get outside the E's range in time.
Most of the cassio's I see (and when I played her too like 2 seasons ago) based the build around used the mask item that makes more damage when more time in combat. Poison is still time in combat,more reason to dont let her catch you.

Basically, use her usage of poison against her. wait for her Q, evade and get near. She doesnt have that much mobility to escape or use her W as a backup.
Pressure early when these mistakes are even greater due to the high mana cost of both farming and engaging.  A good cassio Will predict your movement to evade the Q, take that in mind.
Well, Draven also goes Manamune now, and it's a major improvement
this is true except for one little detail. this unfortunately doesnt work for gold and below because when you as a support leave the last tick of the ward for your teammates they will just blatantly go after their initial play and will not take the ward even if their hardstuck silver account depended on it
So you are telling me that my cs isnt that bad if i get 6-7,5 per minute?
keep playing thresh mate. Don't focus on the rank and play to get better. You can think about what went wrong and what you did good after each game, maybe writing it down and reading it before next game. (also install  [https://blitz.gg/](https://blitz.gg/)  and dodge 30% winrate players + troll comps)

Some things to always pay attention to are:

\- check minimap (you can increase its size [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJp\_\_tuq91k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJp__tuq91k)) YOU are the one that should ping everyone about ganks and stuff, you are not csing)

\- always check who does level 2,3,6 first in botlane, if you manage to get a minion advantage (which you should try to achieve every game as thresh) you can possibly hard engage and get kills, burn summoners) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C65KkoNR0gY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C65KkoNR0gY)

\- adc is the one that should be managing waves, but it helps to know some basics. wave ping pongs between towers depending on minion advantage. People can control how waves move tho. A perfect freeze is 4 enemy caster minions advantage for example [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8qqgVVlN8I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8qqgVVlN8I)

\- roam roam. You have to know when you can roam. Roam after every back if mid is gankable, roam when u see your adc is safe (wave is pushing toward your tower, you just crushed minions into their tower, their support is missing and only adcs stay in lane) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HMquZvdGmo&t=318s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HMquZvdGmo&t=318s)

\- WARD LIKE THER'S NO TOMORROW seriously wards win games, ward everywhere especially their jungle early level if it's safe. spotting their jungle pathing is huge information. A good thing to get the habit is putting down all wards as soon as u can in important spots. then back to refill (CONTROL WARDS ARE OP, 1 or 2 buys every back) you should aim for 1.5 game lenght vision score at least [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU4qtQ8SD\_Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU4qtQ8SD_Y)

\- support yout team, not the adc. Especially in this meta, adc doesn't really matter. 70% of the games are decided by jungle + mid alone and you even forget adc exists (they are still farming to get to 2 items) your area of influence is the bottom side of the map, including mid lane. it is your job to support mid, jungle and adc during early.

Laugh off you're 0/24 botlane getting one shot by a malphite basic ability
Nautilus is easier then thresh but does not offer as much utility.

Morgana if you want an allround good support that is easy to learn. Morgana was my first support and learned me a lot when first playing in the botlane.

Janna is probably the easiest enhancer support to learn but Nami is also a good choice.
it's becoming more common in challenger, maybe it will eventually trickle down a bit more into diamond but will most likely still be rare and anywhere lower than diamond will never be seen, like taking TP on ez in s9.

 For example, master+ euw ezreal has 26% pickrate on exhaust

https://lolalytics.com/lol/ezreal/?lane=bottom&tier=master_plus&region=euw

Aphelios 21% 

https://lolalytics.com/lol/aphelios/?lane=bottom&tier=master_plus&region=euw

caps explained on stream ( he takes exhaust every time on adc) that basically heal is so bad that even when youre literally playing a duo lane it's still bad because heal will frequently not be enough to save you and you just die after using it, but exhaust has a way higher chance of actually making the difference of you living and he would rather take exhaust because TP on adcs is not good because you won't be doing tp flanks as an adc and you should already always be in the fight when it starts instead of using tp for it
That’s not really playing good macro. Playing good macro would be you getting huge advantages in lane with things like minion wave management and back timings and then transferring this advantage for your team while keeping your enemy laner as behind as he was. Going for cs score for the sole purpose of csing is not worth much.
Thank you for this, I've had a mental block regarding CSing for the longest time now. I play ad, so whenever I'd hit something like 8.5-9.2cs/min in a game, have positive kda, and still lose, my mind would shift towards the loss not being my fault, because I did what textbook adc is suppoed to do - "Get a lot of gold, farm well and get strong". And this post gave me reassurance that having 9cs/min is useless if you forsake map pressure and teamfights in order to get it.
It's not a myth tf? If you're smurfing, you should hit at least 8, usually 9, with some 10s. 

If you're in your elo, you should not be going below 6, your average shouldn't be below 7.

that ammount is insane, i've finished games with 30+ minutes where i barely had 100
Korean teams will set a metronome which you can do in that and always look at the map when it goes off. They set it more to 15 BPM which is once per 4 seconds. 15-20 too slow tbh. The concept really really works.
LOL :D I just woke up and am freaking losing my shit reading this comment :D you the best
engage her. she can't do shit about anyone who can get close enough to her. at most she'll try to W you and E away but if your either catch her on CD or gap close she's dead. find out where she is and flank her, she'll be hopeless. Good luck if she has tanks zoning for her thought
Probably bad positioning and risky plays. If you play ADC or mages, stay far away from enemies. If you play assassins, get in and get out or Zhonya, and don't jump into crowded enemies alone. If you generally wish to stay alive more than you feel a need to kill others, play tanks.
Try looking at their items maybe they got a lot of ad so build Armor. Are you a squishy Champ getting sniped by Assassins get a zhonyas . Adapting to the emies is useful and im also still learning What to build against What enemies
Probably bad positioning, hard to tell without seeing your replays.
Look. You can't be the saviour of the game every single time. It's just impossible. Even the top players have bad games, take bad decisions and even lose. IT'S NORMAL to be afraid of messing it up. And it's okay...
You can lose yeah, but you can win too. Don't be afraid of both. You seem to be an experienced player so keep your mind cold (focused) and just play. You can make great decisions and win the game or not but you need to try because if you don't try you"re not losing yeah... But you ain't winning neither.
You can and you will make mistakes but that's part of the game and that's part of learning. 
I believe in you and you should too.
Yeah half this game in low elo is psychological.
When your team kills the Elder Dragon, all team members get a buff for 150 seconds (lost on death) that 1) makes you burn enemies with true damage over time after hitting them, and 2) makes you instantly kill them if you get them below 20% health.
well, as hashinshin keeps repeating and riot keeps ignoring, the only counterplay is a gank early game.
😂😂😂
*150 @20 for me lol
I'm gonna have to disagree with the "insane ammount of damage" part. Sure you do enough damage to bully a enchanter squishy or an adc in lane, but in any game that goes over 30 minutes or so you'll do way less damage than a Zyra, a Brand, and trust me, even a Janna if she's good enough. You can chain CC enemies and bully the botlane, roam the map and assist with invading, safely ward, sure, but your scaling is bad if you don't get ahead, and even if you do, it might not be enough and someone like a nami/janna can get their team back into the game by healing them and protecting key targets. If the enemy has someone like Ornn for instance, at some point in the game he's gonna be way tankier than you are and probably will be able to deal more damage you do because he's getting more gold. They're snowball champions and in proplay the enchanters get targetted a lot because of the squishyness, pro's are not afraid on commiting and spending a lot of resources just to take healers down first so they can't heal anyone in the fight, and also those champs can't ward when the map is dark and roaming alone is just too risky, so coaches will tell players to stick with the champs that can survive warding and early tower diving because in pro-play that's how it is, unless it's a yuumi you'll not see enchanters in the current proplay meta but like other people say, soloq is different and at the end of the day it's only about luck and individual skill, it becomes basically RnG if you don't play a champion that can 1v9. As a support your best hope is to pick something you excel at doing and hope for the best
It's not a single player game. If your team can not capitalize on your split, it's time for you to join the fight. Otherwise you lose, even if you were doing everything right
Most viable methods have already been mentioned
But for some subtle ways to help I can think of some things.
1.Turn off anything unnecessary,for example player names and such
2.Not only enlarge your minimap but transfer your teammates' icons on the top left corner(that worked for me at least)
3.If that doesn't happen already,make sure your jungler wards close to the enemy raptor camp or the pixel bush(or at least point it out for them)so you'll know if the enemy jungler is rotating towards your lane or not.And that would help out the rest of your team of course
4.One other way to almost constantly check is looking for information or at least check how your teammates are doing in between last hitting minions when you're not under pressure
5.Propably what will help you out the most,try to think like a jungler.Learn some basic paths and decision making based on objectives.
Example A:If you know know the enemy jungler started on his bot side jg and hasn't ganked you yet,after after backing he'll propably do a linear path,towards top and maybe gank if possible,so ward.
Example B:If either team got a drake herald is up,it's likely the jungler will rotate top side to secure it.
Not a guarantee he'll gank,but you could go and ward either herald or pixel bush

Hope you find this helpfull.Glhf mate

To quote doinb on his stream (playing ryze mid where he has proven multiple times that he can get 400 cs at 25 mins):  
 “It’s possible for me to have 300 farm at 20 mins. But you guys have to understand our jungler will have 30 by 20 mins”

in higher elo, non-roaming-midlaners that can easily clear chickens tend to be the hardest farmers, so ryze, anivia. Difference between high elo roaming and low elo roaming is the set-up, the best example is dopa,the guy literally is considered the best soloqplayer in the game and his biggest strength is his wavemanipulation. lowelos just hardpush and roam, dopa sets up the push 1 minute before he roams and lets his miniuon slowpush so he loses the minimum amount of cs.
Thanks, I will  
fitting username btw
Gnar is easy, go ahead.
Great! Thanks for the advice i never though about doing that to learn matchups. I will definitely do that.
in my head its always about me in relation to the rest of my game/ my laner

but i play mainly support now so im all about that vision score
Fasting senna is top tier, but support senna not so much. She gets destroyed by engages and assassins, both very popular in soloq, and she can't do much as to peel for the other main carries, her lane healing can be consistent but the healing ammount is easily outscaled by other enchanters. She's great for setting up ganks but she struggles hard without a frontline because she can't properly use her Q to poke+heal ally and it leaves little pressure for her to bully the enemies. She's good to punish people that underestimate her trades, but most people are used to her already. She also struggles to deal good damage to tanks because her dps is very slow compared to attack speed carries or ap's like zyra and brand. She's still strong when she's ahead thought, even as a support because despite all of that she still has a lot of utility and respectable damage and of course infinite scaling. But one thing she can't do is to match up the win condition of a leona/naut that are very simple all in's, the way they lose lane is usually bad timing on the engages or lack of proper follow up, otherwise their engages usually means a bot lane squishy dies or has to spend summoners. That being said i still play her support on soloq because on gold most of the bot carries i get won't properly follow up my leona/naut engage and i know i might end up being useless because i won't scale, but if they have tanks i'd rather pick zyra, if they have 2+ assassins then i know i'm fucked either way so i'll just get nami/yuumi and hope someone in my team is worth helping and my jungler won't let them get a dragon soul in 20 minutes and a baron at 25.
Disagree. A challenger in a challenger game is getting 7-8 cs per min vs enemies that are about as good as they are. If you put a challenger in lower elos they will get higher cs, like 9 cs per min or higher, depending on how low you put them. If you want to climb, an easy way to achieve this is just to raise your average cs numbers.

If you’re bronze and go from 4-5 cs per min to 10 cs per min, you will very easily not be bronze anymore.
dude he isnt trying to get challenger at the moment lol
Blitzcrank is a beginners class to hook champs.

Nami is one of the best enchanter supports in the game and is the second easiest to play.

And Alistar is a pretty simple tank support, he has one combo, it's pretty easy to land.

(by the way if someone ever picks your thresh and doesn't ban morgana, pick it, her E makes his life a living hell)
I agree with you. Picking naut and leona makes you an all in bully, but you start to fall off in mid-late game when some of your engages will lead to your death if you have no flash to get out, your gold income is very limited as a support and so is your hability to tank compared to tank solo laners that are constantly farming and getting superior ammounts of xp. it leaves very little room for mistakes, and engaging without proper follow up by your teammates will render you and your champion useless while netting xp and gold to the enemy team. Bottom line is that you either snowball and lead your team to victory by constantly engaging with a fed adc or a jungler who's camping/ you assist on invades and gank other lanes, or you just become someone that goes in and dies because your team is too weak to do anything about your engages, or maybe they just don't trust your calls. I gave up playing leona on soloq because of that, honestly.
Morgana allows you to practice those skill shots while playing a safe choice.
Keep playing thresh, it's important to play champs that you enjoy the play of in very early days because you're learning a role and a champ at the same time, so stick with him for now. You can watch a couple of guides about how to play thresh or the support role, there's loads on youtube. After some time, experiment with other champs, see if you like the aggressive damage champs or a more healer/shielder champ, there's so many different champs and you're bound to find a few you'll fall in love with

k thank you
A common idea is that all games you play can be divided into 3 categories: games where you can’t lose, games where you can’t win and games that are decided by how well you play. By that logic you’d have around a 60% wr and climb. If you went on a huge winning streak where the games seemed too easy, then a loss streak where games seem unwinnable are bound to happen.
If you like thresh I say play thresh.
lol, thats actually my primary source target. mostly because i jg teemo and hope they say something reportable
It's a metric to use as a goal. If we know what perfect cs is, we can have an idea of how far off we are. No reasonable player actually expects to get 10cs/min, but I sure as hell try to every single game. It's a reminder to continually rack in gold. It reminds me to be patient and not miss free cs, to rotate to lanes, or farm jungle camps.
I definitely could use some improvement on CSing, I'm just unsure of how to tell if I'm doing well. Like what do I compare it to...how many per minute or what? (I'm not even sure how to articulate the question lol) I usually compare myself to the person I'm laning against. I really wish I had someone who could queue up with me and answer questions as they come.
You gotta smite proactively, it doesn't really work to smite when you see the HP drop below 1k at 18. You need to calculate the damage you expect your team to do, then smite. But when you say smite battle, do you mean both you and the enemy jungle is there? Because those are pretty much always 50-50, no matter what level you all are. It's about 50 damage difference each level; that's an autoattack from your adc. In those cases, the problem lies in the call to go for the objective in the first place, not the smite war itself. 

The only way to really get good at it is playing, there's no other way. I guess you could do customs with a friend where you both take smite and do dragon together, then see who gets it?
The [Soviet March](https://open.spotify.com/track/1OS1CHppoO1jLRvmveXvtr?si=h3xGpUVfSZW8-UEx1WSbnQ) from Red Alert 3 began playing in the background while reading your comment.
I think you get a small amount when you get the first win of the day but after that you only get it from levelling up - selling the champs you get from the chest.
Each level up you get a solid amount. Plus each first win of the day you get 50 BE. Overall, it's more than before
Play quinn, if once you've roamed bot once and gotten some kills the second you go into fog of war their toplane spam pings his team
Alternatively, if you want to improve you need to be working on laning mechanics. I have no doubt that a gold or plat player is going to have significantly higher CS averages playing in a bronze or silver lobby. Same with diamond or challenger players in lower elo. If your goal is to climb the ladder, it should also be exceeding the averages in your rank. Just because 4 or 5 CS is the average in silver doesn't mean that is an acceptable amount if it ends up being 6 in plat. If you can't get 6 in a bronze lobby how could you ever expect to rank up?
[FR] When I started I was using lock cam too, a friend of mine told me to force myself playing without it bc it is a bad habit to take. A few days later I was completely used to it. Only you can change this, you have to force yourself to play unlocked and you will see how easy/natural it become and how practical it is for you. Sorry for my trash english
You can tbh. I've seen some high elo players take exh. Probably just remember to use it early.
Focusing in the game.

If you really think about it, tilting doesn't help at all. It makes you play generally worse, stop playing to type in chat, etc.

Instead, focus in thinking about ways to improve the actual situation, to exploit enemy weaknesses, and, in the end, to win the game.

I know you will get queued with toxic players, that is inevitable, but if you avoid falling in the same pit of rage as them, you'll start to see everything more clearly.
I have seen a bunch of toplaners walking bot when they had a good back where they didn't need to TP back to lane, gank bot and then TP top. Sometimes resulted in three kills while not loosing anything top (plus mostly being unexpected)

Edit:TP always gets autocorrected sorry guys
It kind of is though. Last I looked it's around 4 for bronze and 7 for challenger. A bronze player is getting less CS in a lane with an opponent who is worse at trading, zoning, and managing waves. The lower the elo the easier it should be to farm as you won't be abused as much while going for it. If you are in low elo and not pulling 7 cs/min minimum while trading then it's definitely something to work on because if you can only get 4-5 against bronze opponents you will basically be shut out of farming against high elo players.
'I split top, don't engage and don't die!'

'Enemy triple kill!'

Really? It looks like deft typically hits 8-9 if https://www.op.gg/summoner/userName=DRX+Deft is him. 10 might be a fine expectation for practice tool but in real games I'd think as long as you're not messing up individual last hits or missing waves you should catch the number not being 10 isn't something to worry about.
I was gonna ask something like this. Usually 30-40 min games people look to end and make plays to start pushing to late game and with that there definitely would be a discrepancy with the 10 cs a min rule.
This game has a lot of myths people held onto because someone somewhere of reputation said it once back in season 4.
The issue is really that 10cs/m is a practice metric and some people apparently think it is a requirement every game. The goal should be not missing a CS that you are going for. So perfect last hitting save minions you sacrifice to avoid bad trades or to take advantageous trades. it also means efficiently picking up CS in the mid/late game by grabbing a side wave before your team starts positioning for an objective or taking that jungle camp on the way to grouping if you have the time.

It's a goal to aim for that shows mechanical ability and time management reducing your down time. But then you have posts like this that will make excuses because top players sometimes only get 7-9. Realistically, if you net 7-9 consistently you are probably fine and need to work on other areas. 99% of games below gold though are seeing 3-6 depending on role. The only excuse for that is poor mechanics and lack of game knowledge. Either backing at bad times or not understanding what you can or could be doing and wasting that time.
Gosu usually streams in the morning, and sneaky usually streams at night. That’s what I watch all of I wanna watch league. Gosu plays some different champs sometimes , but he teaches some crazy outplays if you look at his daily videos he posts.
>100(+150) physical damage, it means: it deals 100 damage, no matter what. Then adds 150 damage. The orange text means that the ability is affected by Attack Damage, or AD. So, more AD, the higher the damage in the bracket (150) number.

So is the 100 true damage, and the 150 physical damage? I don't fully get what you mean by "100 no matter what", but then under what conditions is the 150 NOT added?

I appreciate the offer to play but I'm in Australia, and since my smooth brain essentially adds physiological ping, I don't think I need to add any more :P
Push those advantages you played out for your team as much as possible. Like repeat gank the same lane multiple times, especially if it worked out before and you know important spells (like flash) are on cooldown.

Lets say for example you come out of base, you head towards your botside. All camps are up there. But you also know enemie botlane has no flash for the next 2 minutes. Instead of clearing your camps first, go directly bot and gank (granted its possible). Then afterwards clear your camps on that side and return bot to gank them AGAIN.

A succesful return gank is not only increadibly tilting for the enemie, but also extremly hard to recover from.
Hmm...can you explain this to me again, but this time like I'm 5? lol...better yet, wanna coach me?
Don't randomly TP bot, do it when you can take something else with that TP, be it bot turret or a dragon.
Understand wave management. Don't TP if your opposing laner is creating a slow push, or you'll end up losing 3 plates and 15 minions worth of gold.
You can learn from both normals and ranked. Normals are great for learning mechanics because you can just focus on winning your lane and winning fights etc. 

But don’t expect people in normal games to play seriously. It’s not their problem if they play sub optimally, don’t make the right choices, pick off meta stuff. Because it’s normals and the result of the game doesn’t matter. So play for fun, play for mechanics, play to test stuff. 

If you were to play only ranked, and take every game seriously, you would improve much faster. People will take ranked much more seriously, so you will learn the game closer to the way it’s meant to be played
> it sounds like you don't even understand the basics of how mobas work or the lanes or even the point of the game

Yeah, you're totally right.

I actually had this thought because I watched a bunch of biographies on various pros and like, 95% of them had played Warcraft III, which I imagined gave them a better fundamental understanding coming into it. Like I got my mum to play Portal and she'd never played an FPS, and the hardest thing for her was using WASD, which took me by surprise because WASD is like, a part of me now, akin to like... knowing how to walk. I imagine I'm going through a similar thing having never played a MOBA before.

BUT I couldn't actually find a resource that explained MOBAs fundamentally in terms of gameplay (I watched plenty of "History of MOBAs" videos) with no inherent focus on a specific game (LoL, Dota, HotS). Do you know of any? I'd really appreciate it.
Just /mute all at the begginning of every and each match. At least until you're satisfied with your strengths. You don't need any words from unknown teammates, juts pings. And you can mute them too if they're abusing it.
So you wanna improve? Ez. be like tylerfucking1 plus you'll be popular
Your title says “how can I focus myself better so I can carry games” but your whole post is just complaining about your bot lane. 

If you really want to focus on yourself stop complaining and ask what you could have done better
Change your setting to unlocked cam, with space bar to lock cam. That way you can have it locked for as long as you want while holding space, and those times where you want to look around, just let go of space. You’ll get used to it over time
it's something you're not used to until you are. just keep playing with it, soon enough it'll feel natural. now I absolutely can't stand having my screen locked.
We no longer get blue essence from playing?
This is really, really helpful thank you. You've explained things more clearly than any video I've watched so far. I'm going to save this and use it as a reference if I'm ever confused or forget how something works. tysm gamer

I have very little experience jungling, however it is a postion I'd like to learn eventually. I'm unsure of a lot of things;  what champions to try,  what path to follow for CSing and what items to build (other than recommended.) To be honest, I think I need a coach to teach me the ropes of this whole game.
Elo hell isn't a real thing. If you play better than an iron player you'll get out of iron. I wouldn't worry about understanding rune pages in depth until at least gold. Focus on the basic of basics like csing, warding, and simple trading
Chances are I'm gonna get placed in Iron, which perhaps that's where my skill level is at currently. But isn't that Elo hell? I remember how difficult it was to get out of Bronze when that was the lowest tier. 

How worried should I be about rune pages? I know it's super easy to just look up a guide and copy it. That doesn't teach me how they work/what they do unless I put time into reading up on it.

I wouldn't say a 'strong' difference.  
Division difference becomes exponentially more pronounced the higher you are; for me the difference in skill between a G2 player (my peak) and G4 player is as noticeably big as the difference between B1 and S1, if that makes sense.
Imo you have two Options.

1. They are your Friends you keep playing with them like you do and try to have fun too Play Things you enjoy or try to learn a new Champ this way you will allways win something.

2. Play less with them to win games especially If you want to try hard. You could consider just playing Alone and Join them If you Just want to relax.
Anivia is more classically mid. Even in her bad matchups she can farm up and play to scale, and had some innate survivability with passive.

Morde is a mid/top flex, IMO as an immobile AP juggernaut he has a lot worse matchups in midlane by comparison (most mages). However he provides some frontline where Anivia doesn't, and guaranteed teamfight utility with his ult.

Consider just learning both? Neither are super mechanically difficult, though Anivia has a lot of unique interactions to learn (particularly on good W usage).
1. If you want to be a jungler. You have to be a jungler. Each patch will affect the jungle and you have to be up to date to win. 

2. You have to learn how to mute allies and not type back because people will fucken flame you for their feeding.  

3. Champion pool wise. Look at the meta and decide between 3-5 champions to rotate to start with. Depends on your playstyle and what fits teams. 

4. Junglers who really teach. Youtube. Kingstix is great. IWD Fz Frost foxdrop are good. [ Remember that games are played differently in higher elo so you can't copy everything they do] 

If ur high elo. Tarzan is probably the best jungler. 

5. Play. You can watch videos and know all you can but you will have a lot of mistakes but you gotta play to get used it. 

Suggestions for champions. 
Warwick, Zac, and Rammus feel solid any time.
Whoops auto correct —- meant to say that seems to be a bit of an over correction.

Is it normal to have a losing streak like this? Does it recalibrate in the long run?

This is my first season climbing so I’m not sure
I know everyone’s saying WW, but honestly I think that nunu is on par with him in terms of ease(I mastered him in around 3-4 games). Nunu also has a pretty good first clear due to the healing from his q and how fast he can get to camps with his snowball. One more thing I love about nunu is that you can steal so many objectives with your q and smite. Since your q does true damage(I think around 1000 at max level), it can act as a second smite. Super epic champ and super cute too!
Note: When ganking, press w and aim.
No idea what your first sentence means, but you can’t do much about feeding teammates. Not even smurfs can do anything about that. However, if you can’t carry winnable games, then yes, you’ve peaked at Bronze, but I highly doubt that’s the case.
>if splitting from the team isn't working
It's most likely just variance. You got unlucky
I hate the restriction of locked cam but at the same time free cam gets me in trouble very frequently. Ive flashed into unseen danger many times
I what I seems to be a step over correction when I have multiple people going 1/10 , 2/13 per game .  Doesn’t seem right or fair. 

Does this mean I’ve peaked at B2?
Another stupid and wrong tip on summonerschool with 1.2k upvotes what's new.

10 cs/min is what you should have in the early game if you are allowed to farm freely. In challenger games, the winning adc or top always has ~100 cs after 10 min and ~200 cs after 20 min but not 300 cs after 30 min because they were looking to end the game.

And also you expected challengers to have 10 cs/min on average which means that if they have 8 cs/min in a losing game, they would need 12 cs/min in a winning game, which is almost impossible.

In a winning game they have like 8 to 9 cs/min because they were doing drakes / barons / turrets and in a losing game they might only have 6 cs / min because their opponents actively denied them farm and that brings the average down to 7 cs / min.

In low elo, you should really aim for 10 cs/min in the first 10 or 20 min because your opponent doesn't know how to deny you cs properly and outfarming is really op. 8 cs/min average would make you climb instantly.
No difference, the game is just balancing out your win ratio
It does take you out of it at any point homie.
Stop doing it
you Can beat them can dosent mean will. can implies possibility 

she has the tools needed to win those. and chall gm otps do win. yes more often then not they dont but they hate the matchup but never call it an unwinnable matchup

Thank you! It's almost like people can't understand how to mentally extrapolate from situations and circumstances that occur in most matches, like being heavily zoned or camped all game, those things add up and most people seem to just never consider it...
Which is also why split pushers are so great to climb low elo. You can always rely on your team fighting. If you’re smart about it, you can be at the right place and take advantage of that. The first time I climbed out of that was playing Nasus and Tryndamere, just staying top and taking everything when people were fighting randomly in the jungle for no reason.
this is only partially true. firstly, the opposition will react first, and despite you having tanky support you will definitely lose the trade. the only question is whether you are capable of not dieing quickly enough to bait them into your jungler coming and 3v2ing them. that is decided by other factors like does the enemy hard cc you, ignite you and does your jungler instantly, and i mean instantly come over to help after finishing the buff. nevertheless, its not worth taking the risk. the right play is pretty always the safe play. to take the safe route and start your laning phase normally.
And then you look at the talon players :) where 6 cs a min is pretty good
I remember times were this was no true and you could solo carry games by doing the right thing alone, gold age time.   


But I could never do the right thing
 IMO 10 cs/min is only mandatory for pro players or very high elo adc/midlaners where rarelly people die in 1v1 or 2v2 and most of the scenerios is  just jungle pressure which can help to cs perfectly. Latelly I have been watching a lot of vods and streams of challenger toplaners and the average is 7-8cs and even some of them (otps mostly) have 6'5cs/min but they dominate their lane and solokill a lot of times. Wave controll is very important, if you have to go 6cs in top in order to freeze top lane cs and force ganks and herald is better than going almost perfect cs and coinflipong objectives.
I was off.  Tryndamere has highest cs closely followed by irelia/ryze

I'm trying to get better at jungling, but I've become notorious among my friend group for not being able to win smite contests. Even if I'm a level or two ahead of the enemy jungler, it just doesn't seem to come together. I'm not sure why this is, whether it's the timing, the pressure or both. What's a good way to practice smiting besides just playing more?

I've tried both quickcast and normal, qc is probably better for timing but I've also found myself occasionally hitting the wrong target when using it.
Literally every OTP Riven in challenger/GM hates all those I listed.

In low elo sure you can beat them, but in GM/Challenger the other side is gonna be just as good as you if it's not autofilled.
Yeah - I was slightly off about irelia she floats between 2nd and 3rd with ryze. Tryndamere has top spot by a few cs.
No... on trynd Tiamat you should be easily hitting 10 cs. Top lane even more
Thanks for trying to give me some advice much appreciated. I see what you are trying to say and I will try to see if I am not helping the team as much as I should be doing. Also, I have tried vod reviews but they have helped me a bit but even still I feel like they don't help me that much, or maybe I am wrong.
You must reach one step farther and achieve Lee Sin levels of sight and blindfold yourself much better than playing locked or free cam but takes rigorous training
You really think people in gold can manage waves? You can literally win every game by CS differential. The only "wave management" down there is pushing. They will literally break T1 and keep pushing while you get 2 levels up.
If 80% of the games are sinner vs sinner, one of them will win. Sure, you could play Qiyana every game, you push get mobis and flip a coin, some times you will destroy their side lanes, others you will get lane kingdomed.
In gold you can just Ori, destroy lane and destroy the 4 random teamfights that will decide the game.
Those elos are single player af.
This is why I enjoy playing jungle. Predicting fights and being in the neighborhood to help out and turn fights around feels so nice and empowering.
That’s not the announcer’s fault. 

That’s my cue to start calling out bot lane for being stupid.
You can diagnose anything by questioning it repeatedly, in the socratic sense. Like this: "What does tunnel vision mean? What is it about my brain, that differs from the brain of someone skilled at processing **multiple** variables of the game state at once, ie:

 ...Jungler location, cooldowns, position+attacks of each minion to see where the enemy will walk up next for cs, mindfully repositioning my champion constantly, mindfully repositioning my camera, checking scoreboard every few seconds, objective/buff timers, looking at the minimap to see the position of all waves constantly to know what the macro plan is now, and formulating a macro plan for the next 45 seconds, and so much more...

It's simply an attention problem, right? What does an attention problem mean? What would it be like to play the game with a high degree of attention? A lot of people struggle with attention without even knowing it. To them, their brain fog is normal, maybe they've had it for as long as they can remember since very often this occurs during childhood/brain development. Most kids these days since TV/Video game era have had severe attention problems cuz their brain is conditioned to stare at one thing, rather than how it used to be for humans for hundreds of thousands of years(eyes moving around all over, processing everything). So you're glued to this one thing, and this is the foundation of tunnel vision.

You can fix this, the *same* exact way you'd fix say, I dunno a muscular issue if you were playing sports. If you are too physically weak and have some extreme condition that makes it extremely hard to lift a baseball bat(even children can lift a bat but just for the sake of argument), you would exercise your arms and upper body right? Simple strength exercise, and then lifting the bat would be easy. If you have attention problems, you train your attention. The exercise that trains attention is called "Mindfulness" -- notice how it's the opposite of "Mind*less*ness", which is what tunnelvision and brain fog is. More on the exercise and how to do it in a bit. You can see this in your team mates if you pay close attention-- I'm sure you've seen someone playing as if they're 3/4ths asleep or in some other dimension/not even on planet Earth. This is the extreme version of attention deficit. Everyone falls on a continuum here, the other end is some high challenger pro player like Mata who micromanages like 30 different distinct game variables every few seconds-- enemy jungler pathing, item builds, sums, the 3 waves, the lane, the game state in the next 10-20-30-40 seconds, just endless variables all seamlessly managed in their brain and calculated to produce the most optimal possible play. If you're somewhere near the middle between the two extremes but still have attention issues, you literally won't even know. This is why it's so difficult to diagnose it in yourself, first, it **requires** the thing there is a deficit of: Attention. Self-awareness is a kind of attention, and if you have an attention deficit, you won't even *realize* you have an attention deficit.

To do the exercise, is extremely simple, but not easy. You sit there and breathe. Sit down, close your eyes. Relax. Take some deep breaths. Sit there until you can say you are *truly* relaxed and just booming silence is filling your mind. From here, watch yourself breathe. Track the sensation of the air as it moves through your nostrils, into your lungs, and back out. Do this for 10 minutes to an hour. It will be very hard. You'll constantly get distracted. You will constantly fidget in your seat. You will think of something, and then 10 minutes later you'll think "Oh shit! I was supposed to be watching my breath and meditate!" This is how utterly pathetic our attention spans are. Sounds boring? That's what a meditation teacher would say is a symptom of attention deficit-- the constant need for stimulation. It's the state of not ever sitting down and noticing, which causes mindlessness. The antidote to this is to do exactly that, sit and pay attention. Who knew that sitting and just paying close attention, actually... improves... attention!

If you're really serious about curing your tunnel vision, or even just improving your life in every possible area, you will do this exercise daily. This won't just help you with league, it will help you **everywhere**. If I told you that you had a serious disease that you tested positive for, and told you this disease causes, tragically, unclear thinking at all times in your life. That would be pretty scary, right? Perhaps you'd say something like, "Wow... I had no idea though... I thought I felt I could think pretty clearly most of the time". That's how *bad* it is if you don't train attention. And in that context, if I had a drug that had absolutely zero side effects, was free to acquire, and I said this drug could make you think very clearly but it takes 10-60 minutes to administer every day and it could take years to work but then when it does you have clarity in your thoughts, this drug would be like... stupidly overpowered to use a video game term, right? We would be stupid not to take it as fast as possible.

That's what mindfulness meditation is.
Yes 6.8 cs/min is the best avg achieved for a zoe main / otp with 80+ games in high elo.

Yes we all understand that some games have 9cspm and some have 5 cspm and that comes out to an average.

The average represents the consistency of performance. 

Just so I can dumb this down... ~ 7 cspm is the current highest average performance at high elo feasible on Zoe after a non trivial amount of games. That average is the ceiling.  no one is NOT trying to get 9 cspm every game..

Imagine telling an NBA player that's leading the league at 33 ppg that he should be aiming for 40 ppg because hes done it a handful of times. And he should really strive for that...maybe even 50 because that's a bigger number. Never mind the avg league leading ppg...


Every performance metric uses avgs . Cs/m , gold/min, avg Kda, vision per hour. Would I blow your mind if I told you your winrate is an avg ? 

Circling back to the 10 cs/min myth especially on champs like Zoe for example - ITS NOT HAPPENING.  You can see what the avg ceilings are from the best players so endlessly pushing this narrative that you should "really strive" for 8 cs/min is utter drivel that the very best cant even maintain. You're wasting your time pursuing something that doesn't exist and that is not where your focus should be at all if you want to climb out of gold. 

You're reaching beyond what's achieved without getting to the same competitive level in the first place. 

In some elos and on some champs reaching for 8-9cs min per game with any consistency is the same as focusing on improving your pentakills. It's a fallacy. Let it go. 


TLDR ; what are the best doing ? What are their performance metrics on that champ? That's your ceiling. Hint it's almost never 9 cspm, rarely 8cspm and on some champs even 7 cspm is rare.
As a tryndamere main I disagree. Sometimes it is much more valuable to be splitpushing.. If they send 2 or 3 people after me, we win a team fight because they're not there. They don't send anyone after me? Free turret. The downside is if your entire team dies and they get an objective off it, which happens a lot in low elo. It's all about knowing whether or not you should keep splitting or join the fight if you are able.

But splitting is absolutely an easy way to win game. If my mid and bot both don't feed, most of the time I will split because otherwise it'll just constantly be 5v5 and objectives won't be taken unless I cause pressure somewhere on the map.
I see plenty of players consistently hit 10, and I personally hit 8 in most of my games, deft is hitting more than that for sure. 10 is a good metric to go by, even though most plat-diamond players sit around 6-8 cs/min, you want to set the bar high enough so that it takes effort. 

It has to do with expectations. 8 cs/min is what I expect to hit every game, so I aim for 10.

If I end a game with 8 cs/min I’m disappointed in myself because it means that I cs’d like shit and showed no improvement that game.
And as a mid laner and Veigar Otp, after first back, both raptor camps are mine.
Mute
No you’re right, he was always hitting 10-11 up until recently, he’s been focused on coaching and his consistency has suffered a bit.
Participating in those “bloodbaths” is a low elo trap. I know it seems counter intuitive, but If you play smart and farm players will literally throw themselves at you. In low elo players are nice folks who want you to feel  like you’re part of the fun, so if you ignore them they’ll just run at you with bags of money.
This is somewhat false, cs depends on a champs win condition, heavy roaming champs who look to snowball early and close out games quickly (because if they don’t the chance of them winning drops drastically) tend to have less cs because of the increased tempo and time spent moving between lanes. However, champs who scale incredibly well, and team fighting mages and adcs should be striving for the 10cs mark because they won’t, and shouldn’t be roaming like a talon. 

The statement about players not hitting 10cs/min is false. I know many players who are extremely consistent at hitting the 10cs/min mark, I’m a garbage Veigar otp and consistently get 8cs/min in plat and when I watch guys like Veigar V2 I see he hits 10-11cs/min in every single game. I specifically remember checking 3 of his EUW smurfs, all of which were master-challenger, and out of about 50 games there was only 2 games where he was below 10cs/min. Sadly he no longer plays much Veigar and mostly focuses on coaching. I do agree with 7-8/min being a more realistic marker, but when you’re like me and already hitting that consistently then you have to raise the bar, so the 10cs/min metric is a great bar to set for yourself to keep improving and it feels good whenever you hit that mark, I remember last season I got my first ever 11cs/min game in my p2 promos and it made me feel pretty great, until I inted my way through a 17 game loss streak but let’s forget about that..
Back when exhaust was one of the strongest summoner spells in the game? Sure.
It's pretty different depending on the champ, but just to give some general info:

- Morello is obviously reworked, so the starting item for mages is now a Haste item, one of GLP (for utility / catch), Luden's (for waveclear / burst) and Archangels (for Cassiopeia, Kassadin, and Ryze). 
- Liandries / Haunting Guide were reworked so now these are more strictly for DOT champs while Oblivion Orb / Morellonomicon is the only source of flat MPen other than Sorc shoes.
- Lethality items were reworked/buffed, now there are more of them. Edge of night now gives a spellshield like Banshee's and Duskblade's ward-spotting passive was extracted to a new item Umbral Glaive. There's also another new lethality item called Sanguine Blade which is made for splitpushers.  

... in terms of mid mostly being mages and assassins, that is the essential info, as far as I can recall
I'm not sure why people have an issue with Yasuo. I pretty much never lose lane to him and generally have no issues dealing with him late. Maybe it's because I'm sort of a Yasuo OTP I can easily deal with him but he's really not as OP as everyone says, especially if the person playing Yasuo is not good with him. Learn how to control your wave to make him over extend. Trade on minions if you have range. Don't fight in the wave. If he roams then it's up to you to punish him appropriately. If he's losing CS because of that and not getting early kills, then it's going to take him a bit to get items. Also try and keep his shield down. Makes life a lot easier.

Edit: Also just CC him. He's very vulnerable when CC'd.
How come it seems like everyone says she’s op this season when last season a lot of people didn’t even consider her viable due to her lack of mobility? I get she’s pretty strong in lane with her q poke and has a really nice ult but why is she all of a sudden considered God teir when lethality varus pokes harder and offers a lot more utility with his ult.
Your KP is pretty low in most of the games you don't end up stomping, while your cs numbers are unusually high for this bracket. Tells me you might be focusing a bit too much on running to sidewaves or are just running down bot and farming.

That's the only noticable thing I see, so you're probably best off trying to get some more vod reviews done. Try the mentoring megathread or discord
If you constantly rage in all chat about getting ganked you will also be a prime target. Constant ganks easily tilt people to the point of rage quitting in lower elos and its kind of a dirty but worth while strat.
You're able to climb on anything if you deserve to climb. Swapping to a role you're worse at won't make a difference.

The people on the enemy team are the exact same elo as you and your teammates so while getting unlucky in the short term is possible it's not something that should hinder you over more games. Start by caring less about what your teammates are doing and caring more about what you could be fixing about yourself. You'll never (or extremely rarely) ever see those players again so dwelling on their mistakes helps 0.
????
That's one minion per minute difference, per your example that's 22 minions, gold avg of that is 385 gold, is that supposed to be huge ?
Well, that's nice to know. I'd imagine 8 cs/min on Twisted Fate is a good rate then?
treat your map like the mirrors of you car. You want to keep your eyes on the road but you check every so often just to make sure your safe. If your about to push up and put yourself in a position where a gank is possible check the map to see if you can see enemy laners. 

Try to keep track of where the jungler is. If you are bot and he just ganked top you should have a good amount of time before he could get to you. Watch drag timer too. If drag is 30 seconds from spawning then the jungler is probably moving that direction and will gank you before attempting dragon if you are too far. Keeping a defensive mind set really goes a long way.
Very easily, especially if the enemy toplaner is a tank with % health damage. Do it all the time on shen.

You get to a point where you either die as trynd, or end up at an impasse where you can't kill each other without inting, so you just have to keep shoving waves and wasting enemy time.
Poppy is generally a counter to high mobility, high damage toplaners. Fiora, Trynd, Irelia, etc all get completely clapped if you're competent on poppy, both from the dash stopping, and the sheer tankyness that she gets.
> How do I no longer one trick a champion?


Play somebody else. You make this way more complicated than it has to be. You're of course going to suck ass initially when picking up someone new
yeah its good for learning teamfighting
>  I got tilted to the point of asking him for his phone number.

Bruh that's hilarious... I'm just imagining you getting camped and in all chat you're like 

>Username has slain yicongCOD!

> [All] yicongCOD: Fucking give me your phone number right now
Nope. The key to playing leona well is to pick really smart fights and understanding stat checks. Leona has no escape so all your fights should be really strong.
Vincent (chinese  Draven otp famous for smurfing and getting 20+ kills) came up with this one

Idk if its the same person, but there was a similar build last year  from a master KR player
with hob. It didnt get the same traction since it didnt have current items+runes
I know I know but it's just so frustrating having to get through this in order for the game to be enjoyable..
Slight different for ad carries. Last time I  checked rekkles averages over 10 cspm
I always saw it at something to aim for, not a requirement, closer to 10cs per minute you are the better
u outrange most champs with sniper so just constantly poke
>I'm level 65, it's the beggening but still more than my 200 hours on this game, I don't get i why the fuck am i against players that spent their life on it and just eat me alive.

Did you.... did you read the post you're responding to? The whole thing was about how this idea is wrong...

>having 10 loses with an absolute 0 kills isn't my definition of 50/50

If you keep playing and losing it will match you with players of your skill **in the future.** Not your current games.
didn't they announce something about adjusting the mmr for roles?
It's definitely better to check online to see, but for the standard mage who doesn't need a tear item it's lost chapter to ludens to morello (I've heard some pros only buy oblivion orb since the full buy of morello is a not worth the stats, unless you need healing reduction on two or more people) and from orb into deathcap and so on. But I think that's what you would build in a game that's going very well, and maybe some champs do better with certain items!
Turn of music.
I feel pretty confident of my warding game when we're close or ahead, but no idea how to do it when behind. What do I do? I can't just wander off into the jungle on my own or I get picked off on my own. I try to make sure I have enemies on the map before wandering off, but a lot of the time they'll be missing so I really can't do much
Does optimal leona play just kinda involve dying a lot?
Oh dear, my eyes already bleed sometimes from my teammates.
True story
Embrace it and try to learn from it. When I have to play in solo-queue versus some LEC pros or top 10 Challengers I lose also almost always, but I see it as a challenge, I learn, have fun, and sometimes win. If you want easier opponents because you don't win enough, you just have an ego problem, that's all.
Yup you're right, mb

Thank you for posting this! This is a topic I've been learning about and trying to apply, both in games and in my own personal life, and this was a short and succinct explanation that tied a lot of things together for me.

I ended up editing the text into a more natural English form for myself to keep and figured I'd post it up for anyone else who might be interested.

Irrational Thoughts that Cause Negative Emotions

&#x200B;

Predictions --> Anxiety ==> Plan and Act

As humans, we need to predict the future in order to know the best choices to make. The only thing we have to rely on is our own life experience; there is no other option. Negative events are, because of our evolutionary survival-based background, remembered first and foremost. We constantly project these negative expectations from our past experience to the future, which leads to a state of anxiety. To cope with anxiety, replace your predictions with planning. Anytime you are scared or anxious about something in the future, ask yourself, "What am I going to do?" Answer that question and act!

&#x200B;

Irritation --> Aggression ==> Acceptance

We often don't notice that we are irritated, and think everything is fine. At the heart of our annoyance are irrational thoughts caused by our expectations. We expect others, and even ourselves, to live up to them. When they inevitably don't, we get annoyed. We are unable to cope with our own requirements not being met, and project our irritation outwards in the form of aggression. An attack or hurtful remark can feel justified, as we rationalize the problem as external, rather than us expecting an outcome that didn't happen. In order to avoid these feelings of irritation that destroy us inside, replace the requirements with acceptance. By learning to accept others, and ourselves, for what we are instead of a perfect ideal we can wash the irritation away.

&#x200B;

Depression --> Explanation ==> Facts

The third type of irrational thought that causes negative emotions is the explanation. In addition to anxiety and aggression, we often experience feelings of depression, melancholy, and despondency. There are always reasons for these feelings, and we tend to overexplain to ourselves why the world is bad why other people are no good. Changing ourselves or accepting blame is hard for us humans to do. We instead burst into endless explanations and travel in a closed circle. This vicious circle can't lead to new good experiences, and of course will leave us depressed. To deal with this, just change the explanation to facts. Don't make up stories about why things are so bad. The more facts you collect, the more objective your picture will be, and your mood will improve.

Once someone said I got babysat and I got tilted to the point of asking him for his phone number. TY for your explaination.
Does anyone know the original source for the new lethality draven build?
What if I play in Iron? Almost everybody can just push
But sure at such levels it doesn't means much anymore but I still get full fucked in those games.  
I'm level 65, it's the beggening but still more than my 200 hours on this game, I don't get i why the fuck am i against players that spent their life on it and just eat me alive.  
There probably are but still, matchmake please make an effort... I'm on the verge of uninstalling because I keep getting reported by my teams for "feeding" where I just try to get my XP under the tower and even with zhonya get fuck even by no dash champs.  
having 10 loses with an absolute 0 kills isn't my definition of 50/50, I know it's what it's meant to do but still nothing to be seen on my levels, levels are just been rising the more I play these days (from 200 to 500 for the most recents games and mastery 7 minimum)

Teacher: NorthQuab

Summoner Name: NorthQuab

League / Division: inactive, was d1 in s6/7 when I played actively

Areas of expertise: top mid jungle, heavy focus on lane control and discipline

Champions: any

Languages Spoken: English

Duration of Mentoring: As long as you provide replays/FPVODS and remain disciplined I'll work with you

Preferred Methods: reddit DM or add northquab#3488 on discord.

Other Info: Coached individuals for about 4 years, worked with Learning Fives program for teams and individuals.

I generally just start with a once-over of op.gg to check for glaring errors such as low game counts or massive champion pools and then begin reviewing FPVODS or replays, preferring FPVODS. I'll review with you on voice and leave you with both advice gleaned from the game review and adjustments you should make to fix op.gg-level problems.

I expect anybody I work with to accept reccomendations I give them when it comes to basic discipline; the first thing I'm going to ask you to do is pick 2 champions for your main role and 1 for your off role and only play those champions and ask you to play an average of 15 games a week minimum. If we pick these champions for you and then I check in a few days and you have 15 unique champions across 4 roles in 20 games or you aren't playing ranked at all, I just don't see the point in continuing to spend time reviewing games if you aren't even really trying to improve. I don't care if you take a while to gain rank or improve, I only care if you're making an effort. I'm not going to ask you to jump backwards through flaming hoops, but I am going to ask that you try.
The reason why vision is important is so that you know if following is safe or not. Annie has an aoe ult so her counter ganks are good. You can alternatively gank the opposite side of the map. Annie’s wave clear isn’t the best so shoving isn’t great, but if he fails the gank then you’ll end up ahead.
Why should the cursor be next to the character?
>Am I right in thinking it is 0.25 extra shielding for every point of AP I have

Yes


>and 0.4 for each point of AD? If so, why does it say "bonus" AD?

There are two different types of AD ratios in league, because there are two different sources of AD. There's base AD which every champion innately has at the start of the game and increases through levelling up. And there's **bonus** AD, which is AD you get from buying items. A **bonus** AD ratio only uses that, so it ignores your base AD. Most AD ratios in the game are either bonus AD (like this one) or Total AD, which is usually just called an AD ratio in descriptions, and takes both numbers added together into account.

For example, look at the AD ratios on ezreal's abilities: [https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Ezreal#Details](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Ezreal#Details). If you look at his q it just says "120% AD", so it works off your **total** AD. If you look at his w, e and r they all say **bonus** AD, so their damage only increases off of AD from items you buy. There are some things which scale only with your **base** AD, such as spellblade damage from sheen and it's upgrades (look at the description for triforce and you'll see base AD highlighted: [https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Trinity\_Force](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Trinity_Force)). However those are very rare, and champion abilities and runes usually only use total AD or bonus AD. If you hover over your AD in the stats tab on the bottom left of your ability bar it shows the breakdown of how much of your AD is base and how much is bonus. The reason there's no distinction for AP is that champions don't innately get AP.

The total value for arey (or anything described like that is just all of the numbers added together). So you take a value between 35 and 80 based off level, add on the bonus AD according to the ratio, then add on any AP you might have according to the ratio. So yes, the total value can go way over 80 (and buying heal and shield power also increases the strength of the shield because it buffs all heals and shields you provide).

&#x200B;

>What is the bonus health?

It's exactly the same as bonus AD, as in it uses any health you buy from items to increase the damage of shield bash, but ignores your base health.

&#x200B;

>Also, it doesn't say the 5-30 is based on level. Does this mean it just caps out at 30?

According to the wiki it scales based on level (even giving a breakdown of how much you get per level if you hover over it): [https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Shield\_Bash](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Bash). Again, it's not capped at 30, everything is added together to find the total.
Just mute them I guess and focus on yourself, and also recognize that there are some games you just cant really carry sadly. At some point the game will be about team fights and team fight execution and if your bot lane was already underperforming you cant expect they will make good plays or position well into team fights, and so even if you are way ahead there may be nothing you can do to stop them from just dying immediately in a fight due to being absurdly out of position and then eventually you will be 1v5 and die yourself.
I know you're just upset about the league experience but I think you're not upset at the right thing.

>get to play against level 500. I am a level 65

I think up to level 100ish, maybe even up level 200, there is a little bit of correlation between level and rank/skill, but especially beyond level 200+  it's not that big of a deal. So don't worry about the level difference too much - you might find level 500s that are trash which is why they're a level 500 getting paired with a level 65.

> I looses almost every of my games. I just don't know what the hell is wrong.

Imagine you wanted to try mixed martial arts and you spar for the first time. You're gonna get hit in the face repeatedly, and that's to be expected. That's ok. It's completely normal. Everyone starts from somewhere. 

If you're not sure what you should be working on, one thing you might want to try is posting some games you played and getting feedback. 

>I am iron 2 even tho I never won a single ranked game of my life.

I think that's appropriate, there are only two ranks below you and I'm sure there are plenty of people who have lost more ranked games out of the level 30 gate than you have. 

>Got to play against golds in ranked

Well, that's how they test new players to see where you belong. If you keep playing and losing, the matchmaking will send worse and worse players at you until you start having 50/50 games.
Its not crazy difficult though? Especially during laning phase, after that it depends on the game I agree
Should I stop playing league and just give up if my useless ass first picked up the game in 2014 and still hasn’t learned anything. I have great Cs(usually around 6.5-7.5 consistently) with decent itemization, a good grasp on on trading(such as waiting for them to AA a minion and playing around ranged abilities and their cool downs). The only thing I think I lack is positioning/target priority in team fights and I have 0 map awareness but I would all of the other stuff would at least get me to silver or gold. I have been playing on and off for about 6 years but am hard stuck iron 2 and finishes bronze 1 last season. I’ve legitimately cried over this many times, wtf is wrong with me why can’t I climb
One trick pony - can only play one champion
https://www.op.gg/summoner/userName=T1+Gumayusi
Irelia has higher cs/min than Malzahar?
One trick pony. Someone who only plays one champion, but is really good on that one champion.
It's sad to see experienced players harping on this because it encourages tunneling for farm. There are other elements in the game that are much more important than near-perfect farm.
Again, yes, you can list lots of different stats that loosely tie to performance but you cant actually use them to produce anything consistently meaningful.

The ranked system isnt meant to be accurate short term, stop trying to evaluate it in a way that it isnt designed to function. 1 game a day is very casual and thats still 300+ games a split. The game is built for people who actually play it
Alright, thanks a bunch!!
it's been a full week where I just litteraly can't do else than throwing games down to oblivion, it's aweful.
If it's late game then why do you care? Just farm wherever open, push waves and as jhin group for fights.
Just play more and lose more as the other comment said. I'm a fairly new player and I can see myself moving between brackets it feels like often. When I've been on a hot streak I end up getting in a match where I'm definitely out skilled and sometimes get flamed for it, and when I've been on a cold streak I can end up in the bracket where the person who got put as the ADC picks Lulu, starts brown boots and upgrades to mobi boots before anything else while having 20 cs by 15 minutes into the game, then buys a Redemption first item. That one is entirely from experience unfortunately.
What’s otp?
Np, remember that lvl 2 comes with the first melee minion killed of the second wave, in the first wave is imposible for him to get lvl 2 so you can play as aggro as you want
Alright, thank you! I did realize i had pretty poor back timings. I'm too used to playing yasuo and graves and overestimated my ability to shove :P

Just a question with talon or any other roaming assassin.
Do you think its better as Annie to just stay lane and shove, or to try and follow the assassin? Because i thought as an immobile mage, it would be better to stay in lane and shove rather than risk face checking into Talon-Eve.
Alright, thanks!! This helped lots. I kept playing back because I was pretty scared of his level two power spike. I guess since I had barrier, i probably could've played more up. Thanks again!

Play more, lose more, and your opponents will become worse.
Death Dance is the best they could have. You still have to deal with two problems: 1. Let's say your team also has a Cassiopeia mid that is fed, what is the ADC really going to do? Build Adapt Helm? But you already put 2900 gold into zero MR and zero damage, you are having an inferior build against the enemy ADC because they out DPS you. 2. Even the ADC is against a full AD team, it is not justified unless the said ADC is like 10/0/8. Not to say building such items doesn't help dealing with something like Irelia or Darius at all.
Been saying this for years.

Also when you look at average CS across elos, it isn't even dramatically higher at higher elos.
Peaked D3, currently plat 2. I didn’t watch the full clip, only until 8 minutes, but from what I’ve seen:

On annie you should almost always take ignite. If you took barrier for defensive reasons exhaust is better against talon.

Level 1 you should be harassing talon, even if it’s just with aa’s. Usually melee champions are disadvantaged against ranged champions so you should try to poke as much as possible. You were standing pretty far back letting talon free cs when it should’ve been the other way around. 
Also, whenever the enemy uses their abilities you should try and trade since they’re on cd. 
Another good time to trade is when the enemy is going to last hit. Either they get the cs and take damage or they give up the cs to trade back.

At a certain point in the game (and this doesn’t take that long) talon ends up beating annie. Annie’s range is too short to actually bully talon and if you go to farm or trade he can jump on you, so be careful.

You do need to work on your back timings. In general, if the enemy resets you should either reset with them or shove before resetting. If you cant shove quick enough then just back. After getting a kill the same logic applies. Good times to back are on cannon waves (this may seem counterintuitive).

When you full combo’d the talon at full hp you ended up getting the kill, but you shouldn’t have used ult. You weren’t strong enough to one shot him so you should’ve poked him down before using ult.

Lastly, if your laner roams, you should either follow or shove the wave, and try to place wards a bit more.

and probably electrocute ignite is better in this matchup since you can easily onehot him
This is why when I get queued mid my ban is basically always Yasuo. It's pretty straightforward for me there haha. If I'm mid and nobody on my team intends Yasuo, I ban him every time. I do the same with Blitzcrank as support usually tbh.
You are playing WAY too safe, talon got away from level 1 without a single autoatack or Q, even when he used his W on the wave (pretty poorly used too) lvl 1 talon is completly useless against a ranged mage like annie

You wasted mulitple times your Q stun, a stun into 2 autos adds up

When you did decide that you could auto from a distance you should have instead thinned the wave and focused on getting all your cs

Seriusly tho, use your stun to make him miss cs and farm with autos

Got too close multiple times for no reason when the wave was already pushing to you

Way too slow to react to the Evelynn charm

In this matchup you should be looking to heavily poke lvl 1, get a health lead that allows you to push even tho your waveclear is worse, if he ever uses W on the wave you walk up and auto-Q him, kite back if he goes into you and stay in range for another Q-auto, also use your stun more agressivly
Which is why we have a year to do it.
Correct but over a larger number of games.  No one wants to sit for 10 hours a day playing ranked and getting flamed just to rank up.
This kept happening to me, and I tried ethernet and wireless. Ultimately resetting my router fixed it for some reason
Some matchups resolve(green) is a better secondary with bone plating/second wind + revitalize. The best way to know when to swap to this runepage, is play a lot, but there are sites which collect data from each match, and u can see the stats, items, runes etc on site like lolalytics.
If you consistently have good stats you should be winning more games anyway.
Yeah, I definitely need to worry less about LP. I always get caught up with stuff like that and honestly it distracts me. Suppose I should train myself not to look at it. I've got my chat disabled most of the time as well to avoid toxicity which has worked a charm. 

"Gold 1 and Plat 4 are literally the same elo, and promos aren't real," is good to hear. I hope to be able to go into ranked games without worrying about it, but mostly it's a peer pressure thing I'm worried about with the folks I play normals with, which might be a sign that I shouldn't play with them. Idk. 

Appreciate the response a lot! Thank you :)
I mean. Low elo players are notorious for not prioritizing CS but chase kills, despite 15 CS = 1 kill. We still have to enforce that farm is so important. 

Has anyone used a CS tracker like Blitz.gg? It tracks your CS and compares it with the average CS of the elo of your choice. Instead of the 10 CS/min. Maybe use the tracker?
one of the most busted items currently. just take it on every ad player.
I didn’t say that it should be dictated by who does the most damage.  You could look at item leads, kill participation, damage to objectives, gold differences etc.  The list is almost endless and in-conjunction with one another should give an accurate representation of performance at least better than the current system where you have to play 50+ games for any difference to show itself.
As I cannot agree, with most of these, there is one simple solution. Decrease the damage of EVERY champion. Last few season, the runes kept giving more and more damage,a lot of items got buffed, inferno Drake ad/ap etc. All of that time, there wasn't any major change in overall basic, damage for any champion, so everything scales very quickly now
My motto is that you should always aim for 10 CS a minute, but never expect to hit the mark.

It's a good sort of lofty goal to keep in mind during your game because of how simple it is to understand numerically. For example if it's seven minutes into the game, I can say "Well I have 60 CS, so I'm doing pretty well this game to be so close to ten per minute". It's a lot easier to quickly do than remembering that perfect CS through seven minutes is something like 76, and that you're almost always going to miss some of that by the very nature of the game.
I'm a support main in low elo. Unfortunately, I'm not having much luck winning games. I'm currently on a 6 game losing streak. I feel as though it's harder for me to carry games because either the enemy sololaners gain massive leads or my bot decides to flash under tower for a kill and end up dying without getting a kill. Should I switch to mid or bot or jungle or stay with support?
OKay but again some champs inherently are better at poking whichd translate to more total damage.

You insist its viable, but i dont know what you are using to back this up. Their best attempt at quantifying performance is what we have, and what we have isnt good.

Rewarding playing for stats is way worse than the current system, winning is the only relevant stat.
Dark Harvest
Taste of Blood
Ghost Poro
Relentless Hunter

Transcendence
Gathering Storm
That's a good point. I do make notes in my head about where I went wrong in a trade or counter-jungle, and I suppose it'd be more helpful to watch replays whenever they're working again. I guess I was trying to express that sometimes I can't turn a personal lead into a win if my whole team is behind, but things like that are inevitable. Doesn't mean I give up though, just need to learn how to play through them and hopefully turn the game.

Thanks for the reply :)
Well I just said damage to other champs during lane phase to make it more viable for roaming mid laners.  I obviously don’t know how they would determine influence but given the data they have there has to be a way to create a more rewarding system in the short term.

It can be complicated but the potential benefits for a system like that would be enormous it would most likely decrease flame and make the game in general more fun to play in the short term.
I think hard commiting to 100 games on a new champion is a good place to start. You can't say "I have a 37% wr" with no real amount of games played. Your sample size may just be too small. Is it 5 games or 50? Also look into watching some streams for the champions that you're interested in. I'm pretty sure if you go to the champions subreddit for whatever champion you're interested in you can find either a stickied post or a sidebar that shows you higher elo streamers that main that champion.
Can you tell me the runes?
But that's so dumb.There are so many variables that you can outperform the enemy team in and so trying to find the 'best' player would be a horrible idea.
I think you can play normal games and ranked games with the same mindset. Focus is on improvement. The frustration comes when your normal game teammates aren't taking the game as seriously as you are, and who can blame them. Normal games are less serious, but it also means they're less stressful. You can try new picks and new strategies, without costing anyone lp. Normals are a great place to have fun with the game and experiment. Ranked is where you'll find more success improving. Your teammates will be taking the game seriously (hopefully), as will the enemies. Don't worry so much about lp. Only focus on improving. The lp will come naturally as you get better at the game. Gold 1 and Plat 4 are literally the same elo, and promos aren't real. Don't flame teammates and mute anyone flaming you. Responding will only take you out of the game and tilt you further. Focus on what you can control, your own gameplay. Pings and team chat are obviously helpful for making calls and guiding your team, but you can only impact the game so much. Just work on playing every game better than the last.
 But again, those stats dont translate to playing well. Some champs inherently do better or worse based on those stats. Some drafts require taking an L early game pressure wise cuz your support wants to play sona and jg wants to play shyv. Whereas some champs have to get giant leads to even “go even” into the mid game. Kills and dmg and vision arent created equal either.


Stats are neat, but thats it.

The current system works. It requires you to play a ton, but it works.
Base Kayn is actually really bad at soloing dragons. Rhaast however deals 10% max health damage with each part of his Q, and usually you have some CDR by then too - so Rhaast is amazing at objectives. Shadow Assassin is alright at dragons mostly because he just deals so much damage - but Rhaast still does more.
People should stop telling themselves "eVeRyOnE hAs BaD gAmEs", because you're completely dismissing the point of a loss. A loss allows you to learn and grow as a player, just because it says victory on your end screen doent mean you didnt lose in the game. You may've lost a trade and learnt how to trade better. You may've got counter-jungled and learnt how to ward better.

Every time you lose, is a test to see if you're willing to learn and grow.
I thought that potentially looking at your stats like gold difference, xp, cs, vision or even damage to other laners during lane phase for roaming champs and compare that to your lane opponent.
You are playing games below your display rank no?
Ikeepittaco is a good adc, especially if you play jhin or aphelios
How do you figure?

Performance translates to winrate long term. Whereas stat based analysis simply indicates a player plays to have nice stats.
Hold on...so you are telling me after putting myself down for my cs so long was actually not worth it?  Low and behold my ave cs of like 6.5 wasn't bad!  Thank you!
Teamo is a pretty easy matchup for nasus, if the player doesn’t main teamo. I main nasus and typically teemo is just annoying to play again the isn’t really a threat and most teamo players are good at abusing nasus well until higher diamond.
Well I’m not even sure if the grade after the game is determined by kda and it doesn’t need to be like that.  Riot has a shit ton of data on every game and it can be a combination of a bunch of data points to create something consistent.
Yes but if I’m winning 70% of my games wouldn’t that mean I’m playing above my display rank? That’s where I’m confused. It’s just always evened out by this point for me if I win streak this much
I have seen it being used more and more frequently.

Against something like a Syndra or Katarina, sometimes unavoidable. They will one shot you, or you have to waste 1k+ gold for hex drinker or you can go exhaust and play around this cooldown instead.
What OP doesn't understand is that just because someone gets a good score doesn't equal them doing well. Someone could have a perfect KDA and throw the game at the same time. Basing ranked entirely off of score would be an even more broken system than what we have currently.
Riot knows their game better than anyone else.  There’s surely a system for it that can be put in place.  The ranked system right now is worse than it would be if it was performance based.
Yes because you're likely playing against people in their main role and losing just hurts you MMR. You would also get better experience against people more to that level of play by starting off against easier players.
As a mid-laner, that blue has always belonged to me, and the jungler is lucky I let him borrow it XD
I think i average 8+ in a good game in low elo. I've had 9.5 before with Sivir but that's Sivir. I've never reached 100 cs in 10min, prob reached near 90 before. I think it's hard in low elo cos fights just randomly start every few minutes and you either join it to get aced or a double kill. In higher elo people don't start useless fights with no objective in mind unless someone was out of position imo, so they just keep farming.
Just play. Like literally every lp gain question, you have no influence on it aside from playing the game.

Your gains are the way they are because you are playing below your display rank.
Quantifying performance is not viable in league, the postgame score is hard proof of how nonviable it is.
10cs/min is your goal when no fights never exist and you have no reason to ever leave lane. 90% of games, doing that will make it much harder to win. Every time you rotate for a fight you miss CS bit you help your team. Even chally games can be complete clusterfucks with a Kill a min and and 6-7cs/min. They just tend to happen a bit less. The difference is if you leave them there, winning lane, they’ll probably have 180+ at 20, but that absolutely is not most games, and those sorts of games are extremely rare outside of really high elo. 

Ever time I’ve had 9-10cs/min in games, I’ve been playing a really strong waveclear mage or a diehard splitpusher, being left to sidelane and pick up one or even two lanes from broken inhibs or just getting split pressure, farming nonstop. I can hit 95cs at 10 on azir half the time if I just never move, but that isn’t a smart way to play.
Personally, I just /mute all before the game starts. Most of the time, the chat is useless and you can commute by pings. I play ARAM as a break from ranked or norms because it's less serious and less toxic. 

ARAM is good in teaching knowing how to teamfight, dodging skill shots, landing skill shots, keeping track of enemy cooldowns, and positioning in a 5v5 teamfight, which are transferable skills to SR. Because you get a random champion, ARAM is a good and less stressful way to first time a champion and see if you like their playstyle given that you are fairly new to LOL. 

A caveat is that it does not really teach you well how to cs or laning early game, which will be quite important. In that case, you can go practice tool to practice csing.
I think the averages don't say much its just important to get every CS u are able to get in the early game.
*40:00, team dead at Baron pit pinging for you to go help*

Shut up losers I'm trying to farm
It's frustrating to see this myth proliferated. Sites like OP.GG and Porofessor accumulate data from all games and they tell the true story. Players in Challenger elo average 7-8 cs per min and it is pretty linear throughout the game (not including the first 2 min obviously). People that spread the 10cs/min advice are completely misinformed and misguiding new players. I bet most people who make this claim are unwilling to back it up with their summoner name
I can recommend Veralion's guide on Mobafire for AP Shyvana. It's really in-depth.
Dude you sound exactly like me,almost hit gm in s9 , got d1 really fast in s10 then dropped to d3. Honestly at the start I was playing quite well, just had an unlucky streak which caused me to demote to d2 which I thought nothing of. Then, I remained pretty hardstuck in d2 for quite some time which was the really frustrating part for me; there was even a stretch of around 12-15 games I had in d2 where I played absolutely out of my mind but still had like 50% wr in that time because of my teammates. I know blaming teammates never gets you anywhere but after watching replays of those games, I really thought I played well and would have won way more if my teammates were just  a bit better. Anyways, I tilted some more and my mental went boom which caused me to drop to d3. I quit my main account around a week before my area went on lockdown due to COVID because I usually played ranked in a PC bang near my uni (my laptop is a bit underwhelming and I usually lag when I play at home due to family members using the wifi , especially now we're all at home). Now I wake up at 1am and  play on 2 smurfs with around d4 mmr (one is plat 2 with 78% wr, other is gold 2 with 86% wr) . This morning I played 2 really good games on the gold 2 account but still lost so I guess I got really frustrated and just for the hell of it queued up for a game on my main. To my surprise it didn't feel that much different from playing on my smurf and I ended up 1v9ing so I suddenly felt like playing on my main again. It is important to take note of that I took a really long break from my main (around 3 weeks) so that was probably enough time for me to fix my mental by playing on the smurfs haha.
So I think a lot of how people should play relates to pre planning your game. Firstly think about what your champion can do, so look at tricks and interactions that work. 

Then think about your lane matchup and what the outcome should be. For example Leona is a bad matchup into Thresh because he can Flay (E) your Zenith Blade (E) and deny the engage. So you know that generally Thresh can beat Leona if she E's in first, so just wait until he flays or later into the game ult first and then stun lock them.

Re-identify your win condition. Sometimes your lane doesn't go as planned, your win condition loses lane or your adc doesn't look like they can carry. Think about alternatives, should you stay in lane or roam to help other lanes instead. Think about which player you can support best to ensure victory and try to stick with them.
I feel like you're really underestimating the pick.

If she uses W for your silence you have a much shorter cooldown and your early damage with E  and W let's you take the trades favorably then heal up on minions with passive.

Idk what world Fioras ult negates you executing her from a third of her healthbar either.

I personally play Illaoi into Tryn and it’s a hard lane for a good portion of the game. I win all ins by forcing his R and chasing him down after he realizes he’s fucked and I have an item lead.

If you haven’t considered this, getting Executioner’s on Darius for Tryn is a death sentence.
Typically going to the lanes with the closest towers is the "proper" call with baron. It's unlikely that even grouping mid if the game is close that you could end. But you are just as likely to get multiple towers and an inhib in one of the perimeter lanes because tier 2 towers are hard to defend.

So you go mid to the tier three you probably get a tier 3 and inhib with the baron (depending on how long you have it they shortened the duration. But unless you ace them at the tier 3 you probably can't end.

However if you go to the lane with the graves you probably take the tier 2, tier 3, and the inhibitor which is more gold. Graves also is not likely to die.

So it's the much safer play to go to the lane with the closer towers up, even if you can group and maybe end with the baron.

If this is lower elo usually running the "safer route" is better. Lower elo players have a bad habit of wasting a lot of time mid so you should always be asking if just going mid is the proper call all the time.
Yeah I tend to OTP champs when I like them. I know other champs, but since I play so much Urgot, I probably play worse on them tbh. But yeah, the classic Push>Vision>Push is what I try to do, but Urgot isnt the greatest at splitting I feel like.
How are you getting rushed at level 1? So if they walk toward you, hit them back. If they hit you, they will take a lot of damage because minion aggro is a lot level 1. What you do notice is that they hit lvl 2 while you are lvl 1 right? So in that case, you back up if they hit it first and wait for the wave to crash into your tower. So try to push for level 2 first and use his sniper range to your advantage.
Idk when "last you looked", but currently Teddy has 10cs/min on 3 out of his 4 most played ADCs(if you round), and at least 9 cs/min on every other ADC. 

[https://www.op.gg/summoner/userName=T1+Teddy](https://www.op.gg/summoner/userName=T1+Teddy)

You can make your point without misrepresenting Teddy's cs/min for no reason.

&#x200B;

And in regard to your point, I don't think people are saying the reason player low elo aren't climbing is because they aren't hitting 10cs/min. Rather, the reason these players are not climbing comes down to a hundred little things: vision, wave manipulation, trading, positioning, etc... Improving as player means slowly closing the gap that you have in each of those proficiencies. A gold player is not magically going to become a masters player by getting their farm from 7cs/min to 10cs/min, but it will get them one step closer.
Also another reason there is more cs in pro games: they  are constantly pushing waves into each other. There's rarely a time where the wave idles on one side of the map.

But in soloq, if you push a side lane past river, as of s9 preseason, the wave will freeze on the other side of the map, so you cant really touch the wave without overextending to get it.
Playing safe and not dying is much better than playing aggressive and dying to ganks, as it keeps the gold and experience difference  between you and the other laner more even. It's better to go 0/0 than to snowball into 0/3 and give the enemy a lead, because you miss more CS and EXP while dead than while farming under tower. Not fighting and being safe until a gank/team fights also makes mid and end game a lot easier because you're both relatively even and aren't going to smash the other laner instantly like some champs can if given a small lead.
Yeah there a definitely a lot of factors that go into it, but generally equally matched challenger players will cs pretty close to perfect if there aren't deaths happening in the lane. Knowledge of knowing how to manage waves depending on your matchup is one of the ways they are able to have more gold than lower elo players.
Do.Not.Join.The.Aram Also you seem to do poorly on anything else that isnt Urgod but you actaully have a good winrate with him so its not a problem.

The most consisten way to carry this low elo games as toplane when you have a lead, is to perform the classic Push > get vision > push more > hit turret/roam depending on if they sent someone to you or not.

Try to minimize the time with your team and maximize the time with the farm and getting stuff
If you say so. But, you said you can't bear to look at yourself without feeling like a major disappointment. Seems to me you've got more problems that just being unsuccessful at video games.

Now, I concede that I don't have a psychology degree, but neither does anyone else here. That's why I advised you to seek a professional's advice, not the people in a video game forum.

What build though is the absolute strongest early game for Miss Fortune? I've taken your advice to heart and it absolutely doesn't work. I 1v1 with my friend, I play Miss Fortune, she plays as Cait. With literally any other character I always win, but with Cait it's impossible. I can farm perfectly, avoid her attacks, ect, I can get the first couple of hits in and she still will get first blood. Her long range allows her to bully in lane and push towards turret. She farms faster because of it. 

How do I beat her? What is the way? Skill point in what first? What build?
Only when their opponent cannot or does not contest minions. Going for contested minions is a great way to end up being denied more later.
That said, if splitting *is* working, pay no mind to bitching teammates. I’ve experienced plenty of frustration at Tryndamere players who are of the (silly) opinion that “I can’t help you in the team fights, I’m a split-push champ.” Which is obviously bullshit, you’re a champion, you do ridiculous damage, and you’re literally unkillable, of course you can help in a team fight.

BUT. It is true that you can, with your kit and build, do much *better* split-pushing. Often times, although it’s insanely tilting to keep losing team fights and barely defend objectives, I’ve still won games just because there’s a rogue Tryndamere, Nasus, or Fiora dusting towers in seconds up top completely unchallenged, since the entire enemy team is busy trying to grind through a single tower mid.

If you’re doing well splitting, don’t listen to whining teammates unless they legitimately and desperately need your help (as in, we’re three champs down and the enemy is pushing towards the Nexus). And that’s more map awareness than anything. The whole point of splitting is to divide the attentions of the enemy team. If it’s working, *keep doing it*.
Mostly comes with experience. As you get more comfortable laning and harassing you can look at the map more.
Thanks. I appreciate the concern - I'm not taking everything here like gospel, and I don't think I need therapy for it. Just a mental block I'm trying to get over.
I’ve played twitch as adc is he much different jungle
Just simple tips that helped me get to plat playing adc. 

1. Farm farm farm, never miss cs gold leads make a difference.
2. Take trades that you know you will win, if you don't think you will win the trade don't take it
3. Also I know you stated the champions you play but if you want you could always pick up MF considering shes op
4. Make sure in team fights you position properly to be dealing as much damage as possible but still being able to not get obliterated by enemy team
You can start off trying easier champs and develop better habits. First focus on your laning, if you need to practice csing there’s practice tool where you can learn the attack timing for each champ you intend on playing. From there you just work on it until you feel comfortable. Game knowledge will come once you play more games. You will start seeing more champions and understanding their abilities and knowing how to play against those abilities will help a lot and you can only acquire this knowledge through continual gameplay. The biggest thing for improvement in this game is to not blame outside factors when you lose. Figure out what you could’ve done better in lost games by analyzing what costed you a bad trade or what caused a certain fight to go south, etc. Narrowing down key moments in a game and remembering not to make the same mistake in future games is an essential skill to climbing quickly.

Thank you for the advice. I played jungle back in the day but after the big changes I could do it anymore. It’s my worst roll right now. Today I tried to pick up Trundle with all the tips everyone has given me. It’s a world of difference already! I know most champs from playing arams so much, but I really like one tricking to really get to know a champ. I try to change it up when I get bored of a champ though. I think I will try jungle in norms for a bit to understand the finding more and I will definitely look at ward placement videos. Thank you for the advice!!
Your logic is all over the place my guy. If the average is 7cs/min, the absolute best cannot be 7 cs/min.

Why would you EVER consider the average as your objective to reach? If you want to get good, you should not aspire to reach the average, you should aim for higher cs (8-9 cs/min+ even 10). You'll eventually get bad games where you get 5 or 6cs/min, and those games will average with your good ones and get a 7 cs/min score, which is good.

That's how it works.

> It's your initial post that this thread is about. People really drank the koolaid and it stuck around while being patently false. Easy bet that you DID NOT know Zoe had such low cs in high elo...but you really believed they MUST be at least 9 cs /min bcuz "muh challenger 10cs/min secrets to climb" 

What? Why are you throwing accusations and being this passive aggressive? It really shows how childish you are, and that would also explain why you cannot understand what average means.
Hey guys, I have been playing league for about 5 years and my highest has been high plat in the recent seasons. Lately, because of the quarantine I have been playing a lot of league and I have been trying to climb back up to Plat 4 and I have been super hard stuck. I mainly play Jhin, Jinx, Ashe, and Lucian and I am pretty comfortable with these champs. I can't really tell whats the cause of me being hardstuck since in the recent seasons it was way easier to get back to Plat. I have sought out coaching and it has helped a bit but I still seem to be stuck in Gold. Because of this, my mentality has become pretty shit and I am confused about what to do. If you could give me any tips it would be greatly appreciated :)

Heres my [op.gg](https://op.gg/): [https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Hastiez](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Hastiez)
Yep
Heal helps in short fights as well as extended fights. If you misuse exhaust you will lose your trade/fight most of the time. The timing for that leaves little room for error unlike heal where you can hit it at any point as long as you are above 1 hp and it will provide its use. The movement speed buff also comes in pretty clutch for repositioning whereas an exhaust relies on you having to slow someone down that is trying to run you down, a situation you can fix with better positioning for the most part.
I have used music to keep me from tilting when I first started and it distracts me way to much. But I keep like a metronome in the background now that has been really helping.
ashe is great rn, what you talking about?
Only time I ever hit 10 cs a minute was when I was taking every wave late game as 12-1 riven at 20 minutes and even jungle camp. Game ended at like 27 or 28 and I had a little over 260 cs. Unless you’re free farming all game and never back unless TP is up it’s really not possible.
It takes a while to learn where to go after the towers fall. I'd say if you are going for something, commit to it.

I looks like you play top lane. I'm mid gold top lane so not that good but not bad so take what I say a grain of salt. 

One of the things you can do as a top laner in low elo is to push side lanes past the river. Don't push too far out of vision, just push a wave if they are meeting at the river then back of. Or if the lane is on your side, push it out to the river then join your team for whatever stupid fight they are taking. Most important thing is that you don't die while pushing sidelanes. Back off if you see an enemy. You can do this even if you are behind. This will also greatly improve your CS.

Doing this will just passively give your team pressure on the map. Your teammates may not realize or properly use the pressure but the fact that it exists is helpful. 

I reccomend watch JaySea on YouTube. He has done multiple Bronze to Diamond series and is really good at explaining why he is doing certain things. Even though his Bronze to Diamond are from the last 2 seasons I still think there are very useful to watch since macro play does not change that much. SoloRenektonOnly is also good at explaining why he does certain things.
Exactly.

This is what the thread is about. This perception by players that got ingrained by the "muh challenger 10cs/min secrets to climb solo q"

Its patently false. I invite you to look up your adc champs and see what the best players avg for cs on your server. The best miss fortune players avg about 7-8 cs just for reference.
Absolutely.

That actually makes sense
i always thought the 10 cs per minute was a target goal to practice last hitting- specifically to know your damage for a last hit so you don't lose easy money that quickly stacks up.

&#x200B;

The games players has gotten much more sophisticated even at lower elo's though. there's kids in gold and plat that know how to set up freezes, and when to/when not to. That wasn't a quite true 4-6 years ago. Nowadays, you realistically will never hit that 10 cspm unless you're already hard stomping your laner
Because it sucks ass, that's all there is to it. You lose so much early game pressure from not having heal ADC + ignite support. Yes, late game it's good, but ever since its nerfs and the ignite buffs, the amount of pressure you sacrifice isn't worth occasionally not getting one-shot late game.

(EDIT: Apparently caps started giving up HEAL for exhaust, so exhaust ADC and ignite support. This has been meta on Yasuo bot lane for a long time so I can see it being okay)
>I know that kiting is about moving after you shoot, something that I usually do with Graves as well as other ADCs.

Close, but that's attack moving.

Kiting is when you're delivering auto attacks but also moving in the same direction as the opponent; if he moves forward, you move back; if he moves back, you move forward, if he moves west, you move west.

Specifically, you need to have a clicking speed to react to your opponent's clicks quickly, to both change direction when needed and keep shooting. Furthermore, you'll need a clicking speed high enough that you can react if your opponent surprises you; since most casting windows in League are 0.25 seconds, you'll need to be at least 5 clicks per second, (one click is 0.2 seconds).

Lastly, you need to be accurate enough to not commit any faults. If you go to right click the opponent, miss, and click the ground...now you're walking *toward* the guy who needs to be close to kill you. That's *bad*. Although, you can protect yourself by binding a-clicks to a mouse button and only clicking that button near the opponent.

Are you able to do that?
Definitely believable. I used to get mauled by good Shens until I learned the matchup, and now it's one of my favorites. If both sides know the matchup it becomes a "no u" game of patiently waiting for the other player to blow a cooldown lol
Wow this is really helpful. my boyfriend who was trying to teach me when i first started playing (hes a support main and im a adc) he would drill into my head that 10 cs/min is pro level and is expected in higher elos and that i should be aiming for 10. currently my average is 6-8 depending but i always felt that i was doing so bad since 10 was the 'standard'. but reading this really helped my mental! <3
>stated nobody else on our team had ap so why would I buy that item.

Yeah dood just do only physical across the team so they can stack armor and become unkillable that'll surely work out well for us \s
Who is getting exhaust on ADCs? I have almost never seen it.

Heal + Barrier bot lane is so, so, so much more common.
Hey man, I used to play league casually like 5 years ago and took a long break until July last year. My wife and I decided to get back into league and boy it was rough. We started in Bronze 4 like you even with my prior basic knowledge of the game! We ended the season in gold 4 though after tons of work and a lot of games. Basically what I’m here to say is that this game is super hard to learn despite what some people will say. There isn’t really a magic answer to your issues you’re having and a lot of it comes down to experience. You definitely should practice last hitting to the point where u can think about the game state while you’re csing. Since this game is so complicated you need to devote your brain power to the bigger picture and not have to tunnel on farming minions. 

For stuff like when to roam and those macro questions, try to think about the game organically and come up with your own solutions. For example you are Playing pantheon often, his ultimate lets you teleport around the map and pantheon has crazy damage early game compared to most champions. So think can I kill the enemy laner? If the answer is no then how will you take steps to progress the game in your teams favor? You have a teleport ability and there is a dragon that just spawned. You can use your ultimate to come down and secure the dragon for your team. 

You will learn the game through trial and error eventually by coming up with your own solutions. Here’s another example, back when I played in season 5 the games took much longer and it was harder to finish the game. All of the guides on YouTube taught me to farm farm and farm. When I came back to the game and played ADC, I would focus on picking up as much farm as possible even ignoring my team thinking that I can conquer the late game. That wasn’t working for me because I would be super farmed up but my team often had lost dragons and towers and I was there finally to try to defend the inhibitors. I figured that I would start sacrificing farm and move with my team and support my team in their movements and plays and I started winning more because we had numbers advantage when we were taking objectives.

Basically what I mean is just keep playing, and make sure to keep an open mind and diagnose issues that caused you or your team to lose and try your own solutions! Good luck man I have no doubts that you will be a fantastic player very soon
> I'd also like to add that Shen wins trades at levels 1 and 2 with Q+W if he takes grasp.

Hell I've even been able to kill renek at lv 2 by taunting him after he blows all his cooldowns. Renek likes short trades that he can dash away from, if you stop his dash away and smack him you can give him a spook.
Tier lists are opinions, there is no one perfect tier list. Even professional teams can have completely different reads on the meta. (And this will cause weird meta differences between regions. For example, Karthus jungle was relatively popular in China but almost no professional NA jungler played Karthus)

If you really want an "accurate" tier list, look at the tier lists provided by everyone and find the commonalities between them.
Cleanse is better against Zoe
But then u lose a lot of kill pressure that can potentially snowball 

An old graves player hit master using exhaust only
> You are negative before the game starts by looking at there level and mastery level on champs. That’s a big no! I personally go into every game thinking I’m the best mid laner and no one can beat me. 

I start the game, check the mastery of my mid vs the mastery of the enemy yasuo. Unmastered vs mastery 7 yasuo. Internally I'm like "whelp rip our midlaner"....

Then I press tab later and the yas is 0/8. 

Mastery ain't shit.
> One time a challenger player was in my game, no joke, 

>ive never had my ass kicked so hard

What champ did they play? Don't tell me it was some shit like Janna
yeah i used to get shit on by yasuo when i first started. riot will never nerf him cause too many people dickride him

my advice is just wait for him to overextend and punish him. 90% of yasuos play stupidly aggressive at times and its really easy to catch them off guard and put them in their place

You just proved the point in your post..

Just to illustrate or give a frame of reference:

If a high elo Zoe main were to average over the course of say 100 ranked games a 7 cs/min avg that would be THE HIGHEST CSING ZOE ACROSS 3 CONTINENTS .

And your reference point , which further proves it, is Perkz ? One of the best midlaners in the world avgs 7 cs/min on zoe after 20 + games...

But you're still sticking to 7 min/cs is default ?!?!? 7 cs min avg IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST on that particular champ across 3 continents in high elo. 

Find me this mythical 8-9 cs/min avg high elo Zoe player and get him on G2 stat. If Perkz can barely even out to your default...

Averaging 6.5 cs/min over 50 games as Zoe is fking spectacular in solo Q. That's the real.

It's your initial post that this thread is about. People really drank the koolaid and it stuck around while being patently false. Easy bet that you DID NOT know Zoe had such low cs in high elo...but you really believed they MUST be at least 9 cs /min bcuz "muh challenger 10cs/min secrets to climb"
Just fyi Vegair V2 is not the head coach of FNC, but rather the strategic coach I believe. Mithy is the head coach. Not that it takes away from your point at all.
Hey player from the netherlands here,  i really stand open for some good feedback and advice. I hope you might like to give me some. Im a gold 1 toplaner. Massage me if you like. IGN: Vosa Unchained.

You can use it aggressively, but you can honestly use any summoner spell offensively or defensively...
You are supposed to get 10cs/min assuming no fights are happening. 

If you leave lane to go to a fight in river, of course you will lose cs. 

But to say 10cs/min is impossible is simply wrong. Especially for splitting top laners, it is not uncommon to see around 10cs/min in challenger. 

But u will notice that these players rarely fall under 7cs/min even while fighting and roaming. So if your cs is consistently 6/min you obviously have room for improvement.
i'd rather them emulate that play and get their team ahead while complaining rather than go to baron and get their entire team wiped by a qiyana ult. 

We see the game differently that's pretty clear gday
Isn't part of the reason supports take it because it can be used aggressively as well as defensively? As supports are the playmakers in early game it makes sense.
